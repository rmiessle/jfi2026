"My dear Mother I hope this finds you as it leaves me at present. I have got a moment to write to explain what has happened since I received orders for abroad I left Farnborough with the transport, as you will remember I told you on Monday morning to embark on the South Coast We were ready to board ship at 3 o'clock and embarked by 4.30 We left port at 5.30 and had a very interesting journey across with an escort to look after us but I suppose I mustn't say much about it. While I got a bed in a cabin the men were all lying down below with the horses and miles on the Emigrant deck above (the ship is usually employed in sailing from Europe to America with cargoes of Emigrants) and very uncomfortable they were. However as the ship was about 10000 tons there was simply no motion of any description and the passage was perfect. We reached the other side about 5 but did nothing [illegible word] when five officials boarded and we were allowed to collect everything & disembark – In the process they threw some of our ammunition overboard and all our pack saddles disappeared which were probably purloined by someone else – However we had to the ordnance about them & got them in exchange. We left dock at about 2 & had some hours before leaving which we spent in a rest camp. I got a few hours off in the afternoon to go up to the remount camp to see Cecily as I daresay she told you. We left the camp at 11 & on getting to the station had to load up our wagons & horses for which they gave us 4 hours. The arrangements were very bad & it took us all our doing to get on board but we were ready by 4 am & left then. We had one or two little incidents as the mules were fearfully obnoxious & one of them nearly strangled himself by getting down between the train & the platform & another absolutely refused to go on board at all. Luckily they did not belong to us but to another battn. We had a very slow journey across country & got to our destination at 6 where we detrained & had orders to go into billets for the night & meet the rest of the Battn the next morning & come with them out here It was rather a game getting into billets as it was dark & no one knew their way about. However we were in by 9:30. I split a bedroom with the O/C the other party had to sleep on the floor in consequence. We met the rest of the Battn. the following morning & had a 12 mile march out here – where we are in billets. This is quite a small place about 200 inhabitants & the men are billeted all about the village in barns. The barns are filthy, but the take it in good part & we shall get them clean in time. Headquarters are in the local school which is not closed & the companys have various messes in different farms I dined out with A Cy last night & found them very comfortable. I sleep with the CO in the Mayors house about 5 mins. walk away & am quite comfortable there. Yesterday we spent in getting the billets into some sort of order as it rained hard all day. To day we are having the Companies out but it is still very wet. We expect to be here about a week & then move further up country where no British troops have been yet. The British Tommy is very amusing to watch. He is quite at home & armed with w small phrase book can get most of the things he wants. A lot of them are helping to milk the cows etc & generally making themselves useful & I expect it pays them – I came across one yesterday who was in great trouble as he had dropped the farm bucket down the well, but was quite unable to explain what he had done. Fathers mouth organs are a tremendous boon & I heard most dismal noises proceeding from a farm last night which proceeded from one of them, while the platoon sat round & howled in unison – I will write again soon but the supply wagon will shortly be returning & this letter has to go with it. Yours Jack. ",1915-09-04,Mother
"My dear Family. Very many thanks for your letters & for the mosquito & fly lotions. We are not bothered by either insect here though they may come in useful later on. I hope you are enjoying the weather we are having here. it is simply perfect. On Monday our Corps Commander turned up at the Brigade Hqrs about 4 miles off & all the officers had to go over & see him while the men went on a route march. Yesterday we had to have a field day for his benefit & he expressed himself as satisfied & went off so I hope we shall not be worried by him again for some time. We thought we had done with all the Aldershot business when we left & it is rather annoying to start it again over here – especially as it only makes everyone rather stale. I had got another horse now which we secured at Havre & have given over my other to the Doctor. The new one is a Canadian Heavy & in poor condition but is a good deal larger than the other & will carry me better & when fed up he should be about the best animal we have got. So I am rather pleased with him. We (the officers) were all photographed by Gale & Polden Aldershot before we left so you should be getting some copies from them before long. I couldn't order them myself as I had to leave before the proofs were ready but someone else ordered them for me I believe. There were no chance to get the Battalion photographed as a whole. We are still in the same village & not likely to move for the present I believe. Anyhow we are safe to remain till the end of the week. At times we can hear the guns at the front, bit very faintly. They must be 30 miles away – at least. The post reaches here one once a day. It is brought up with our supply wagons & we send out our mail when they go back. The supplied come from the A.D.C. depot about 6 miles off. We are still rather looked on as wandering sheep by the authorities. Anyhow we do not get things anything like as easily as they do further up but of course we are rather off the line. Anyhow I daresay when they discern we are here we shall get papers & letters less than 3 days after they are sent off. The Cos son who is in the Cavalry Signalling Corps was over here yesterday on a motor bike & he gets his Daily Mail on the afternoon of the day it is published. 3 of our officers have gone up in a bus to day for instruction in the trenches & I daresay they will send some more up when the first lot come back. Our feeding arrangements are still rather primitive, but that is the penalty of being in an empty house – the Dining table is made out of an inverted bedstead with two of the school blackboards placed across it & the seats are boxes which after a bit seem rather hard however our latter ends will get used to them all right eventually. My bedroom cher m. ls marine is very comfortable though he and his family do not appear to wash much – their appliances are very deficient & he confesses that when anyone wants a bath they have to get down to the station & go some mules by train to find it. I fancy that all the baths in this country have been marked down by the British officer & are stored on the map as highly important features – The supply wagon has arrived & is just returning so I must cease. I will write again shortly Love from Jack. ",1915-09-08,Family
"My dear Family. Many thanks for 3 more letters. Its no use strafing me because I don't write. This is the 3rd letter & APC that I've sent since weve been out & I only left England last Monday week. To had the impudence to say that I didn't write & I find that odd has been putting him up to it. You ought to be as sincerely grateful for my letters as I am for yours – well to continue where I left off (which seems about 2 hours ago) we had nothing much to do on Thursday except shooting & I rode over the place all morning with the C.O. The partridges here would delight J.R.P.'s heart & I would very much like a go at them, but it is not allowed for one thing & for another & more important thing I have only got a revolver to go for them with. So the Partridges go unscathed. Yesterday was a similar day but just after lunch we got the cryptic message ""move"", so we had to set to & get ready to go. We had every thing ready in an hour & then we were told that it was cancelled so we went back again, the only consequence being so far as I am concerned that I lost my razor & am now feeling like a clothes brush - However it has turned up & I shall be smooth again shortly - To day we have been on a Divisional show with the 73rd BOC about 5 miles away. Luckily we were in reserve and didn't have much to do & when we did the whole thing seemed to be fairly muddled. However the G.O.C. said we did all right & everyone patted everyone else's back at the pow wow & the Corps Commander turned up and said he was very pleased, so we got back at 2.30 seatheless . To-morrow we should only have Church Parade, unless the Brigadier sees fit to have us out, but he has been ill for the last 2 days so let us hope he remains so. Out 2 fellows have returned from the trenches where they had a very interesting time & are chiefly impressed by their comfort – once you are in, they do leave you alone, or more or less so – apparently there was very doing in the part where they were, though their was some shelling further south & I can hear guns going to-day. We have been warned of a couple of spies in the neighbourhood & last night a sentry help up a Res X Car & as it refused to stop, he fired a shot over it. It stopped at once & 2 Drs got out with their hands up, very agitated – we are rather pleased that the 1st shot of our campaign should have been fired at our own men & in addition to a Res X Car I had occasion to take the skin off our Transportation Officer the other day. I heard afterwards that he pathetically remarked to someone that he wished he had gone into the Navy. So my powers of invective must be improving – we have now got a number of men billeted on the manor & they pervade his farm. As my window looks over the farm yard & they have established their kitchen in the middle , I hear a good deal of them They are amusing blokes & one of them is now setting all the fowls in the neightbourhood agog by crowing like a cock – I can hear cocks all over the place answering him – they were allowed to do the field day to-day without their packs & it is extraordinary what a difference it makes – it quite upset our calculations as to the time we should get to the rendezvous this morning & we arrived there 20 minutes early – Very many thanks for your suggestions for sending things. I have given an & should get all I want Send out weekly We are not absolutely away from civilization as there are towns fairly close where we can get anything from whiskey downwards - When we get further up country we should be quite all right – Perhaps an occasional cake would be welcome but that is all I can think of at the moment – The newspapers are arriving though rather irregularly, but as I have said before, we are no mans child at present & things will be better later on – I hear we are drying up the village wells, so we may have to move out, even if we don't go from the district – However this is only my idea & the wells may be all right Yours, Jack ",1915-09-11,Family
"Dear Odd, I enclose a cheque for £1- would you mind getting something for G. somewhere & sending it to her. I have written to tell her to expect something. We have had no orders to move yet. Another gorgeous day & incidentally the anniversary of the formation of the Battalion. Nothing doing except church parade in an orchard this morning, where I went & indited letters. Lunch with A. Coy on good English Beef washed down with cider, which is a filthy drink [to] have & since then I have been watching portions of B Coy sweating like little beavers playing footer in the only meadow, which is big enough for the purpose. It is full of mole hills & has a large ditch down the middle. Otherwise the conditions are ideal – the footer war poor, but as Tommy was nearly as bad as the other I imagine the conditions were hardly suitable. To-night I sup with B Coy, then a little poker & home to bed. I hope mother will approve of my Sabbath. I went into my billet just now & found the whole family & a caller gathered round the drawing room table, drinking & making merry & as my bed-room leads out of the drawing room I had to make my apologies & break in. They were still drinking when I came out about 1 hr later, so I shall expect to find them (blast this ink) [begins to smear] all under the table when I go back to-night. They thrash the corn in a most unusual way here – by horse power. They have got machines like tread mills & the horse is solemnly put on this & by walking constantly up hill, the thing he stands on moves away & the corn is thrashed. This doesn't sound very lucid, but if you turn it upside down you may make something of it. I find that we are in a district called Artois & the natives are called Artesians. They are the inventors of Artesian wells, as no doubt, dear child, you well knew & are generally regarded as the biggest fools in France. Their womankind certainly look very sheep like & the old men like rams. The young ones I have not seen as they are all a la guerre. The products of the country are chiefly pigs & cider (& I regret to say that the men have now found another known as brandy actually Mathy lakes (??) Spirit of the Strongest). I found one drunk on Friday & most peculiarly so & another one last night – but it will not occur again or the ladies who own the Estaminets will get bolted. Love from Jack. ",1915-09-12,Odd
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter & newspapers received this morning. We had another slack day yesterday shooting & such like only the natives are such idiots that they didn't realise the danger & insisted on gathering in the corn just behind the butts or ploughing just in front of them. They have quite changed from the fright they had when we first started. We started out for a long field day this morning, but as it rained hard & the men have only one suit of Khaki, they sent us back just in time before the fine weather came on, in which we have been basking since. They are going to take us out again I think, so we shan't get off it. I hear that in the local county town on Sunday the Priest preached a sermon on the good behaviour of the West Kents, who are billeted there. We are far more innocent than they so we should probably have been garlanded with wreaths if we had been there. Apparently they are greatly surprised that they can go about their streets without being molested, and that their orchards are not robbed. I am not so sure of the orchards, as one notices men bumping up against apple trees, quite accidentally of course, & their palls strolling up shortly afterwards & happen to find a few windfalls, which have been examined to find that they are much bruised & when it is found that they are covered with bruises, it is a mistake to put them back as they would only make the good ones rot, when they fell. We have got a grenadier Corporal over here now, trying to teach us to throw bombs, but he is a priceless ass & we know as much about it as he does. I was throwing one to-day & found out afterwards that it was a real one. Apparently they are practicing with real ones, fully charged, but without the detonators. However no one seems to mind. We sent out machine gun officer on a course at Hqrs. last week & he came back disgusted, as he knew more about it than any of the instructors & the whole thing was a farce. Incidentally he had to live in a filthy camp, which is occupied by swarms of bugs of varying kinds & we are now disinfecting him. So I am becoming prepared for the joys in store. I hear the Zepps. were right over the West End of London last week & got a number of houses in Holborn & near St. Pauls. They also say that one was brought down at Hendon, but I don't know if it is true, though one of our fellow's parents say they have been up to see it. Love from Jack.",1915-09-14,Mother
"My dear Family, Very many thanks for letters from F.M.&O. also for a large parcel from O of various delicacies. As a matter of fact I have chocolate & cigarettes from Harrods regularly, but the cake & chocolate biscuits were quite welcome to the mess & have by now been devoured. We are still in the same place & they don't seem to be in a hurry to move us. I believe we are going out to-night to practise a concentration of troops & it looks as if we are going to have a lovely night for the job. If we stay here till the beginning of next month we shall have to find a new Headquarters as I believe the school is to re-open then. We have already been looking out for a mess room in place of the very uncomfortable one we have got upstairs & have found it in a farm near by. We are at present negotiating with the Landlady who is evidently awful fond of money & she wants the equivalent of the rent of the whole house for it. However we may let her down in time. It is extremely hard to find anything to say about this place. We perform the trivial round daily & so far as I am concerned this is extremely trivial as I have nothing whatever to do except to wander round and criticise people who know how to do their job much better than I do. One humorous thing I noticed today. I was watching A. Coy practicing scratching yesterday. This sounds uncleanly but it is in fact the process you go through when unable to advance under fire & you lie down & dig a hole for yourself with an entrenching tool which is carried for the purpose. When they had dug their holes, which of course look like a line of graves when finishes, they have to be dilled in & I noticed to-day that each grave has been finished with a little + a tombstone at the head. It was most pathetic till you realised what the young devils were like, who treat such topics so lightly. I went to watch the machine gunners to-day practising. They have dug themselves a beautiful little trench all tunnelled and replete with dug-outs & hidden loop holes etc. They did some firing against a neighbouring hill but the bullets must have been richocheting all over the place but I trust that no one was been killed. If any corpse is brought in it will be decently buried but not a word said. My only entertainment lately has been in ragging the brigade office. Their Staff Captain is quite a decent fellow but rather too big for his boots & carries on as tho he was incapable of making mistakes. We caught him out yesterday in making 3 distinct & several errors & spent several hours in concocting cryptic & sarcastic answers. The adjutant saw him to-day with the intent of rubbing it in but he wouldn't wait. But I think we have triumphed. We have still been left severely alone by the Brigadier lately but the C.O. has had to ride over to-day to see him, so it looks as if that great and good man is re-awakening & we shall have to begin to mind our ps. & qs. As regards footballs, we should like a couple very much later on, but at present we have 2 new ones each per company, which are quite enough to go on with. I get some revolver practice most days & am becoming quite a fair shot with both hands. I go out with the C.O. & the poor old chap gets very annoyed, as he used to be a good shot (so he says) but he cant hit a hay-stack now. He gets so awfully nervous & rattled nowadays that Lord only knows what he will be like when we get further up. I suppose it will be my job to keep him soothed, though I don't fancy it very much, I return a letter addressed to Col. Peirs which is intended for father on the subject of discs together with a p.o. for father therein. Would you mind arranging for the Autocar to be sent to me weekly & the Locomotive Magazine Monthly. Uncle Jos has made me a sort of offer for the pram but I am not keen on selling it unless to get something more suitable as the family go-cart. However I will wait to hear from him. Lest I forget I don't think the pram is registered in my name. Anyhow I have not paid any tax on it, so if father would mind writing a line about it & let me have the form to sign when he gets back to town I shall be much obliged. I suggest that the Surrey people at Kingston are the best to approach as the London C.C. ones will want to fine me if they discover that I've had it so long without paying tax or transferring it into my name. Those idiots I got it rom promised to transfer it had have not done so. I think the Surrey Council will probably give me a new number without asking questions & Wardhill can they paint it on. I hope some of you will soon learn to use it, as it is only eating its lead off & I should like to hear that you are having runs in it. Yours Jack.",1915-09-17,Family
"My dear Family, Another Sabbath & still where we were. A beautiful day & I am writing in the orchard behind our headquarters. There are not many apples left & I presume that others have been here before me. We had a very gruelling day yesterday. We got our orders at 10 p.m. on Friday to leave at 2 a.m. & to march 8 miles to a concentration & then to attack. This meant my getting up at 1:30 & we got to the place all night at about 5:30 & then I think the Staff found out they had made a mistake & the attack was supposed to begin at dawn & in face it had been light for a long time. There was a thick sea mist all the early morning, but that cleared off & we had breakfasts & strolled rather aimlessly across country for 3 hours & then another 8 miles home. It was then very hot & the men felt it very much as they had had little or no sleep & only 1 meal in the 12 hours. We got in about 2 & so to bed. We had no mail yesterday & it is not come in yet to-day 2.15, so have no letters to acknowledge except father & others on Thursday & Friday. Frosard the padre came over to take service to-day. He now lives over at Headquarters with the General. He has no information to give us except that he had gleaned from his brother, who is in the French Army that things were going very well & that there are horrid things in store for the Bosches, but the time when I suppose I should not say. The French are much less keen on Censorship as we are & take as many photos as they like. I don't think it matters much whether there is a Censorship or not as for instances Henriques our machine gun officer has just come back from 24 hours in the trenches & has a story that 2 days before he was there the Canadians were he was with had brought down an aeroplane & had found maps of all their trenches with the dug-outs marked & a black ring put round the Cos dug-out. Incidentally that dug-our had been heavily shelled & destroyed just before & they were then building a new one. So if they knew such details as that there cant be much they don't know. I wonder if Olive ever got my letter containing a cheque to be spent for Gs birthday. If not I wonder if someone would mind spending £1 for her & I will send another cheque. A Coy. Have rather an amusing mess here as they are in a farm & very comfortable, but their room has no door except into the family bed-room in which the two daughters of the house sleep. So if they return late, they have to stroll through the damsels room, while they are in bed or get in through the window. Now that Jerry has cut his hand in falling in through the window, I suppose that method of ringens is closed, so they will have to put a bold face on it % invade the damsels room. Luckily the damsel mint it far less than Jerry & Peter. With regards to sending things out, I am very much obliged for the suggestion, but I am supplied regularly with tobacco & cigarettes & we have ordered a box of things to be sent regularly by Fortnum and Mason to supplement the ration. However a small unexpected delicacy is always welcome, but nothing very large in quantity as we are limited to the amount we can take about with us & until we are fixed up for a definite period I think it will be better not to have too much. We are only supposed to take 35 lbs. of personal things with us & I have got about 70 lbs. now. Tho of course I've got a horse to convey the extra amount & the amt. carried in the baggage train does not exceed the 35 lbs. The Censoring of letters here is a most unholy job. I think all our men in their spare time must be authors or at any rate newspaper men. They write reams daily which all has to be censored by the Coy officers before it goes off. We encourage football & such to keep them from writing but it appears to have no affect. I am not directly concerned for as I have said before I have nothing on my hands at all, but it makes the Coy officers blaspheme as it is all done by candle light. I was doing the same the other day & I came across one young devil who wrote 2 love letters by the same post to 2 different young ladies, one in Worthing & the other in Brighton so he had not been wasting his time. The post has just arrived & I see I have 3 letters. Fathers on 16th & a parcel of quails, mothers of 16th & Cecils of the 12th. The quails might be v. useful but they are rather heavy & the question of weights arises again. The way to address me is as you like except that 8th Queens B.E.F. is all you should give in the way of distinction. They hold them up for a day or two at the Post Office if you add the Division or Brigade & they send them on with a printed slip pasted on the back to say that the Division & Brigade are not to be mentioned though none of mine have been hung up yet. I am writing to C& G by this post a similar letter so you needn't worry to send this on, tho Olive might like it. Yours Jack. ",1915-09-19,Family
"My dear Family, I hope this finds you as it leave me at present. Am looking forward to a new billet as am under orders to move to-night & you must guess the place as I can hardly tell you its name, but it is about 10 miles rom here. As we are moving we have had no mail, but should get one when we reach the new place. There were tremendous rumours that we were through the Dardanelles yesterday but the are probably not true. However as they arose from the local postman they may not be so incorrect as usual. The CO has gone ahead to-day to spy out the country, but will be back to-night or we shall meet him on the way. They had a respirator test here the other day when one of these Staff people came along with a cylinder of Bosch gas & filled a trench with it & then people walked through it & came out coughing & spitting but all safe. The respirator is just like a sack to fit over the head & neck & fitted with a piece of talc to look through. The talc has a habit of splitting & letting the gas in. Then of course the thing is of no use. You feel nearly suffocated when you put the thing on but some get used to it. They also give us a 2nd kind to use in addition which is merely a pad to put over your mouth & nose. I believe that eventually they are going to serve out a thing which is good against every sort of stink known or unknown, but it has not arrived yet. I have just given my tunic to my servant to sew a pocket on the inside to keep these things in as they are both saturated with chemicals & drip ceaselessly. Rather good story overheard after that long day last Saturday morning. As the G.O.C. was getting into his car to go home, ""E gets off his orse & gives it to his groom & E gets into his motor & E as a whiskey & soda & E looks out of the window & says I wonder 'ow these poor beggars will het 'home & off E ops. I must now cease as I am going to get my hair cur preparatory to our move. Yours, Jack. ",1915-09-21,Family
"My dear Family. You will have to read this as a continuation of my last which I hope to be able to send off with this to-morrow. While we have been on the march, we have had no chance of sending off letters. I got a mail to-day including mothers letter of the 19 and fathers of the 18 and Olives of the 18 also two magazines from mother for all of which I am much obliged. I have just heard that an excited French interpreter has passed through today and said that the allies are through the Bosches line and have begun their advance but this is probably one of the usual sort of rumour. We had a very heavy march last night 19 miles which is more than enough for men with packs. It is a lovely night with brilliant moonlight, and ideal for a march of reasonable distance. Yesterday morning we spent in billets resting after the previous night. There was a river in the place and the men had a bath and enjoyed it very much. I was in the drawing room of an empty house with the other officers of the Hqts staff except the C.O. who had a bed in a farm. It was a beautiful morning and I spent part of it sleeping out on the river bank. The natives both male and female were strolling up and down while our fellows were bathing but no one minds the little things here. We moved on about 6 o'clock and had a simple hill to climb a little way along and we thought the transport would never get up but when they got into it they went up like birds. We got our to our billers which were at the beginning of district what I am and were ------ . very few of the men were under cover but it was a fine night and the men slept out quite comfortably in orchards and fields. To-day has been fine but a thunderstorm has come on to-night and it has begun raining. However we have got more of the men under cover and those who are not have put up bivouacs for themselves. My own billet is in a house and I have a bed but I am rather frightened of it and slept last night in my valise on top of the bed and was quite comfortable. The bed is in a curious little room leading out of our feeding room and is raised up about by steps – I don't know what is underneath my room but it is something pretty swiffy . The whole place has a peculiar reek and I can't quite analyse it yet but two of the constituents are pigsties and general filth. I will let you know the rest when I find them out. The place owns a large shell factory which is periodically bombed by German aeroplanes. And the distinct generally seems pretty busy, as there is a bit of traffic and shouting going on at night. We ran into a little of the local pave' road last night but we got off it soon as it is infernal stud to march on. I hear there is another mail in to-nights so I may get more letters and possibly some newspapers, which will be interesting as I have seen no papers since Monday. Yours, Jack. ",1915-09-23,Family
"My dear Father, I am too miserable for words. We have had a most awful doing and are reduced by half, the C.O. and Charlie Crossy both killed and probably 3 more and the rest out of 12 wounded. We went into action on Sunday with 20 officers and 10 came out. I am quite all right, tho why I wasn't touched I don't know. The Brigade is reduced to about 1500 and I believe we are to go back to reform. The men were wonderful and tho caught on the flank by machine guns and later on by wire they went on as if on a field day and when they couldn't get through the wire the strolled back. I got left behind on a flank with a platoon and had an awful job to get back over 600 yards of open ground with snipers at us all the time. We got into the trenches on Saturday night and the attack came off at 11 on Sunday. We were only warned ½ hr before and we got caught because the Brigade on our flank let us down. The G.O.C. of the Division and Brigade have both complimented us on our showing and except for the misery of having such a fine Brigade cut up, I should feel quite proud but I am simply heart broken now. The Corps Commander has also congratulated us and said the losses were not in vain as the attack kept 18 Battalions of the Bosches from going to help against the French. I will write more when I feel more cheerful and will give you as full a description as I can. The map of our distinct appeared in Monday's Telegraph showing the district where the operations went on on Saturday and we went over the same ground on Sunday. Yours Jack. Please don't say a word about Charlie as they had getter get the official information first and I do not know absolutely for certain that he is killed as no one has seen his body, but I am afraid he is. Jo is wounded, but only in the foot and should be home soon. His mother at Mount Herman Road Woking will give you his address and if in town he may be able to tell you about it all.

"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter of the 26th received this morning and a copy of the Autocar also for Odd's letter of the 21st. There is a very large post to come up yet so there may be more letters to be acknowledged. I am afraid you have had no news of me lately but we have been on the move and pretty well occupied with the Huns and one thing and another and I have had no chance to write. You know that we left Herly last Tuesday week and did a ten mile march Eastwards at night to Glem. The next night we did a 17 mile march to Berguettes, rested a day and night, and on to Bethune the next night where I had a very confortable billet in a large home. We moved out of there to go up to the firing line about mid-day and of course were then beginning to get into the thick of things as we met a lot of the Germany prisoners who had been captured on that (the Saturday) morning and were within sight of the observation balloons and aeroplanes. We got up to Vermelles about 2 and waited for 3 hours and moved on up to the trenches about 5. At Vermelles we were surrounded by our own batteries which were going off all round us but were not actually shelled. We moved our of Vermelles over a honeycomb of trenches pitch dark and raining and were told that we were to do an attach and we eventually got into the trenches we were to start off from about 4. These were the 3rd of German 1st line trenches which had been captured in the morning. We got our orders for the attach at about 10.30 A.M. and the attack began at 11. It is very difficult to give a good description of it all. We began to get shelled when we got into the trenches and the shelling got very hot bout 8 in the morning but I don't think any of our men were hurt except scratches. The Huns had managed to spot the junction of two trenches when the C.O. and I were at one period the shells were coming all around like peas but not one pitched in. The attack was in the German 2nd line trenches about a mile back and we were only attacking a part with the 3rd Brigade on our left and the 21st Division on our right. Just after leaving the trenches we came under machine gun fire through the shells were coming over pretty thickly and about 800 yards down the shells ceased to worry but then we caught it from a battery of machine guns in a village on our flank, which was intended to have been cleared. We got through this and eventually reached the wire in front of the German trenches, but they couldn't get through this so we had to get back. The Brigade suffered very heavily. The W. Kents and E. Surreys attacked in the fist line and we and the Buffs were in support, and consequently did not get it quite so hot. The C.O. was killed early on and we lost 11 other officers in casualties so we are now greatly reduced. As always happens, regiments got hopelessly mixed up and till 12 that night I could only find seven men of the Battalion. The following morning about 4 we moved out of the trenches and were releaved by the guards and we are not back in Berguettes sorting ourselves out and are moving somewhere else at once where I expect we shall remain some little time. They have now collared Fox to go off and command the W. Kents who were left with 1 officer and Cox has gone to the 2nd Battalion the Queens who have no officers left. So we are being depleted. I am very much afraid that Charlie has been killed, but I can get no information for sure. I also think Cooke must have gone and there are several subalterns of whom I can hear nothing. It is terrible to think how badly the whole bridge has suffered and I am only thankful that we have suffered slightly less than anyone. However we have been told by the G.O.C. of the Division and Brigade that we could not have done more and the men were in fact simply wonderful. They strolled back from the trench when they found they could not get through the wire and were more than an example to the New Army as they were told. One of the New Army Divisions bolted from the trenches when the shelling began and everyone in the rear though that there had been a tremendous disaster. I don't think that there is much fear of that and from what I have seen I am quite confident that we shall be through their lines very soon. It is curious to think that I joined as a 2nd Lt. a year ago to day and now I am in command. What a life. Yours, Jack ",1915-09-30,Mother
"My dear Family, We have again been moved, this time northwards, and though I cannot name the place I may say that we are still in France, but the people carry on as though they were in Belgium, and in fact we had to cross into Belgium and out again to get here. We left our last billets early this morning and came some of the way by train and the past 9 miles by roads which are the beastliest I have ever been on. Where they are not inches deep in mud they are rough pave however they are all right again here. We are in a little market village, but there are one or two shops to get things and I have not had a chance to get into a shop practically since I left. The inhabitants are look and speak Flemish and are rather boorish compared with the others we have met. I have got quite a good room in the main street with a window on the roof about 4 inches by 3 but to make up for it the landlady informs one that the bed is very good. One thing is that it is a land of good drink as the white wine is A1 and the beer very pleasant and we only have to go 2 miles to buy cigars without paying duty i.e. into Belgium. We had no end of a time getting off this morning as one party had to leave at 3 and the rest at 5:30 and it was very cold with a white frost. I lost my Burbury on Sunday last but have gained a great coat instead so I am all right. If the P.O. will take it would you mind sending me my British Warm coat and a pair of khaki wollen mittens and my khaki scarf. If the P.O. will not take the coat I think it would be better not to send it and I will get another cheap one here. The Brigadier has billeted himself just opposite so I shall expect a warm time when he is his own bright little self again. At present he is seedy and is not here, so I am respited. Yours Jack P.S. I am v. glad to hear father is learning in the pram and hope it is running all night and that he had fathomed its intricacies. I think the reason for the shift steering is that the tyres on the front wheels are slightly different sizes. ",1915-09-30,Family
"My dear Father, We are just moving out to go towards the trenches & I expect we shall be in them permanently within a few days. At first they will put us in a few at a time to learn the ins & outs of the business. I wonder if you would mind choosing for me & sending me out some kind of a waterproof I don't think Burberry's or are the thing, but it should be a waterproof & if possible with a fleece lining (detachable) I have seen the sort of thing I want out here, but cd. not find out its name. Curdings could probably tell you what is best & faute de mieux one of their oil-skin coats at about 27/6 would do me all right. I also want a pair of trench boots & shall be very much obliged if you will have them sent out at the same time. My usual size is 9 ½. The trench boots are waterproof & some are made of green canvas with a leather sole & others of various kinds of waterproof. I think the green canvas ones are the best. I will send you a cheque for the whole thing when I hear what it is. With regard to the coat, I see I said that it should be a waterproof. I do not mean the shift rubber sort, but the one I have seen was slightly ribbed & evidently had a canvas or cloth foundation with a rubber solution worked in, & was quite pliable. I am sorry to worry you about this but it will be a great blessing if I get them as I have lost my Burberry. Yesterday On Sunday we had a Brigade service & a very kind message was read out from the Brigadier who is away ill. I am trying to get a copy & will send it you when I can. Yesterday we were inspected by a new G. O. C. who has taken over the division. Yours, Jack ",1915-10-05,Father
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter of the 3rd inst. & Mother's' of the 2nd. You will have had my letters by this time explaining last week's events. Since I last wrote, I have had a lot to do as the Battalion is being refitted & what with new drafts & the training of various specialists one's time is pretty well occupied. I sent 300 men up to the trenches on Tuesday to see how things are done there, & I came up myself with another party yesterday & am now writing this in a dug out in the firing line. It was very quiet last night & this morning but the gunners have started now & are making a fit of a noise at each other. I personally am going back to-night & the others are coming out to-morrow. It is fairly comfortable here in the dug-out with a table & chairs and a bed dug out in the wall. Both sides have snipers going at each other through loop-holes all the time but they don't seem to have much effect on each other. The trenches here are not very deep, but built up with sand-bags & the important ones are all boarded with a gully beneath. As it is dry I do not know how they drain in wet weather, but I expect they get pretty muddy. However there is no reason to suppose that we are going to take over this bit of the line & at present I have no idea what is going to happen to us. When I get back to-night to where the Battalion is, we are in huts of a sort but rather crowded & when we all get there & especially when we get made up many of the men will have to bivouac, but I think they will be able to make themselves pretty comfortable with walls of sandbags & waterproof sheets over the bivouacs. The inhabitants of the district are distinctly low German & I don't think they would mind very much if the Bosches did come, but I imagine they are not representative of the nation as a whole I must stop to catch the post love from Jack ",1915-10-08,Father
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letters of the 6th & 7th received this morning, also for yours Olive's & Mother's of the 4th & Mother's of the 5th, which I got this morning but which reached here yesterday when I was up in the trenches. Our Adjutant Stacey (Captain) is at the Royal Free Hospital Gray's Inn Road & you might be able to glean things from him only as he is wounded in the jaw I don't suppose he can talk much. I now understand he can't talk at all. However I am quite sure he would like a visit, if anyone is in the neighbourhood. Tommy is in hospital in Ireland & Lofting & Price in England but I do not know where The cakes have not yet arrived, but are no doubt on the way. Many thanks for the Aquascutum coat, which sounds exactly right & also for the boots which should also be the very thing. I will let you know more when they arrive. I am back in the rest camp still getting things sorted out. We have now got a number of tents & are consequently not so closely packed and more comfortable. Since writing the above two mighty cakes have arrived which have been duly cut into & greatly appreciated. Now that we are going into trenches a few odds & ends in the food line would be very welcome, as they vary the diet. Another interruption, as there is trouble about some returns which do not apparently add up but the discrepancies have now been explained & the staff Captain sent away happy. Please thank Mother very much for the socks which are always useful especially thick hand knitted ones. In the trenches it will always be difficult to keep the mens feet warm. I have been expecting the Divisional G. O. C. round to-day & everything has been very spick& span for him, but he has failed to turn up & consequently the brass taps have received their unaccustomed polish in vain. We are losing our Trench Interpreter to-day, not a bad little chap but rather inclined to weep, when he gets into difficulties & much less useful than he thought he was. I take it that we shall now get a Belgian, but I don't know that we really want one except to cope with the inhabitants who want to be looked after pretty carefully – not that I have had any trouble with them personally but they were fairly ungracious when we went round to get billets & rob the British Tommy like burglars. I must now cease love from Jack. Joey is at No 1 General Hospital Camberwell I enclose a copy of the Brigadiers message Would you mind keeping it for me? I will send a copy to the Cressys. I wonder if my Equitable Premium has been paid. If not wd. you mind doing it. £12. ",1915-10-09,Father
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for the Coat which arrived to-day & is the very thing. It is beautifully warm & far too hot to wear to-day – not that I want it as it is very fine, but when it is cold it will be ideal & it can be made lighter by taking out its inside. There is a tremendous noise of shelling going on in the distance to-day but as it is Sunday it probably means nothing unusual as the Hun makes it a practise to stir up the British on their day of rest. However we seem to be stirring him up fairly severely in return. I heard to-day that for 3 months the Huns were supplying Armentieres with electric light from Lille without knowing it. They must have been fairly sickish when they found out. Apparently the electric mains were under both lines of trenches & they didn't know it. There is some excitement on at the moment as Archibald is busy on a Hun aeroplane. I have seen them try to hit lots but never one touched. I saw a whole squadron of 14 French aeroplanes the other day & the looked very jolly with the sun on them. I think they were out on a bombing excursion but of course I could not see what they did. I was very interested to hear about Marlow & Seer Green (if that is its name). When at Herly I saw the name of a Captain J. Pears in the 6th Oxford & Bucks L. 1 as being wounded & I wrote to him in the chance of his being able to let me know something. I have had no reply & it may be that he is not going to write but if he does I will let you know anything I hear. He may be a relative. In this place we can get hot baths in a brewery. These are a great blessing for the men, but I have not faced one yet. I manage pretty well with a canvas bucket in the tent door. Poor old Fox has not got the West Kents after all as they have sent out a senior officer from home. The Brigade & everyone are very sunk & so is he as he was just getting into it. However I hope it means that he comes back to us but I am not sure. Love to all from Jack ",1915-10-10,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter of the 7th received to-day. If you want to see about our show, it is all in the Surrey Advertiser of the 9th in which you will find incorrect allusions to myself. These do not allude to me at all but to Fox & I have written to say so & if anyone mentions it to you please contradict them at once. That idiot of a Private who wrote the letter doesn't even know the name of his own Company Officer & ought to be slain. Lofting (Lieutenant) is in hospital at the Empire Hospital Vincent Square & I am sure would be glad of a visit. We had the G. O. C. round this morning & had a few minor faults found but nothing to speak of. We are going out for a route march this afternoon only about 6 miles to give the men some exercise. We have got a Y. M. C. A. tent here, which the men appreciate very much. there are also baths in a brewery but I think I mentioned that. I have just heard that Duke who was wounded & missing is a prisoner & not badly wounded except that he could not get away. There are still 3 more to hear about for certain & I suppose we shall be hearing something soon & I am rather more hopeful about the others, as if they have taken one officer they may have taken others. Love to all from Jack. ",1915-10-12,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for yours of the 12th recd. 15th & for the copies of the Brigadiers message. I hear that it is being printed & I daresay copies will be sent out. My object was to preserve it. I have sent a copy to Col. Morgan at the Depot, who tells me he is putting it in the Surrey Advertiser. Many thanks for ordering the S. Advertiser for us. I am still worried about that letter of that idiot Lintott's & the worst is that I have got to live up to it!! I have written to the S. A. to tell them that it has nothing to do with me & I don't see what more I can do. I am now in the trenches with about 600 yards of the line to look after. We came in on the night of the 15/16th & I have been pretty busy since. However we appear to be settling down all right & bagged a German Sniper yesterday. It is a comparatively quiet part of the line, but there is plenty of incident The trenches are only in fair condition and want a lot of work on them to make them really safe and comfortable. We have got a very fine dug-out at headquarters for our mess & a separate one for a bed room with a bed in it made of a wooden frame & wire netting. It is fairly comfortable & I slept well on it last night as I had not been to bed the night before. It is a trifle chilly in the early morning as it ^ (the dug-out) has no window, but the mess has a beautiful door, an arm-chair clock window & various other chairs, looted from Ypres I believe. The place was originally made by the French of for one of their generals & they protected the good man's head fairly effectually as the roof is made of 3 10 inch iron girders & thousands of sand bags. I have been wearing the trench coat & now have the boots on. they are both a great success & I am very much obliged for them. I suggested to Jo. a little time ago that when he was able to do so he might use the pram but he will be some time I imagine before he may use it & in any case he will have to learn to drive but this is of course subject to any of you wanting it. I thought he might like it during the week when no one else was using it. I would like to let you know more about our life from the military side, but I suppose I ought not in case the letter went astray. We seem to have a very normal life with meals at the usual times. Everything is done by telephone, so long as the wires are intact & my job is chiefly to stay at headquarters & direct things from there. I wander round the lines daily to see what they look like & that the improvements are getting on, but each section is run by its own company officer, who knows far better than I what he wants done & he gets a free hand. Things are much quieter here by day than night & at the moment one could not tell form the noise whether there is a war on or not. It will wake up again after lunch & then the strafing is more or less ceaseless till breakfast the day after. Please thank Olive & Cecily for their letters of the 13th & also Mother for hers, the date of which I am not certain of as I have not got it on me. I hope Bogey is all right again Jack. ",1915-10-17,Father
"My dear Father, This is only a postscript to my other letter. I take it the bond you are buying is from the Peareth Coy & not the Peruvian Gold Mine. I quite agree to your suggestion, but don't see really that it should go in my name, as the dibs are yours. However that will be as you like & very many thanks for the suggestion. The parcel of eatables sounds as if it will be very good. It should arrive to-night The footballs will be very useful later on, at present we have some others. Yours Jack ",1915-10-17,Father
"My dear Family, Many thanks for letters from you all (including two from G.) received yesterday. I have been informed to-day that our Divisional G. O. C. has applied for a Regular C. O. for this Battalion. This is very sad as the Brigadier told me 3 weeks ago that I should have it & he repeated it again to-day & said he was quite satisfied with me or he would not have applied, but apparently he can do nothing. I also saw the Divisional bloke & asked why I was to be superseded & he said that it was necessary to have someone who had been out in the trenches for some time & that otherwise he would have been quite satisfied to let me have it. They are all very nice about it, but that doesn't help things However he may not be able to get anyone, so I have not given up hope yet. We have been in the trenches and are now out again and I fancy will be behind the lines for a bit yet. We didn't have a very good bit of the trenches to hold as we were both sides of a canal and one side was continually being strafed by the Huns both by shells & mines. I have never seen such a place, full of holes & craters & the top of a small hill simply pounded to bits. They didn't put up any mines while we were there, though they put up an enormous one the morning we got in & we were busy putting in mines to stir them up. I believe, when we go in next, we shall be going to a slightly different part of the line & a little further to the South where things are more straitforward. While behind the lines our chief job will be to put up huts & to make ourselves as comfortable as possible for the winter, as we shall use this camp when we come out. We are drawing lots of wood & stuff & I suppose I have got to superintend the job. Luckily, I have discovered an architects' clerk in the Battalion & Barry is an architect so we ought to get along all right. Our latest new draft have had to be isolated as they came within range of a cerebro case somewhere on the way & you know how fussy these medicos are. So there are now 200 miserable youths in a corner of the camp languishing with a guard over them & all sorts of penalties hanging over them if they break loose & they've got to stay there for 10 days. Many thanks for going to see Stacey & Lofting Yours Jack ",1915-10-21,Family
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for yours & Fathers letters of the 19th & for Cecily's of the 16th, plus a box of cigarettes also for a copy of G's letter of the 13th Sept. I have got the mittens etc. all right, also a copy of the Autocar & a copy of the Engineering Review to-day. The trench boots have also arrived, also a parcel of eatables & cakes from Father which were very nice. Our new C. O. has not yet arrived & I don't know who he is to be. I think the Hun must know by this time where we are but I will do no more than say that we are within a few miles of Poperinghe, but I expect you have guessed my whereabouts by this time. Your stories of the Zepps are very interesting. I hope it is true that they brought two down but I fear not, as a Zepp is not a thing you can easily conceal. We have a summary of information sent round to us daily which is supposed to tell us what is happening, & lately it has been quoting a lot from letters found on prisoners etc., all of which seem to show that the Huns to say the least have got the jump, both here & in Russia. There was a very funny one to-day which reads as follows. It is a (I'm sorry this sheet is so filty I didn't notice it but I am writing in a tent by the halo of a tallow candle) quotation from a soldiers diary & some of the entries are as follows. ""Lieut. Reinecke was drunk."" ""Lieut. Reinecke was drunk again."" ""Lieut. Reinecke was very sick."" ""We made an attack to-day Lieut. Reinecke was heard to be shouting Vorwarts vociferously from the second line of dug-outs."" ""Our Lieutenant Reinecke has been awarded the Iron Cross"" from which it appears that Lieut. Reinecke knows how to look after himself. Another letter of the other day signed Anna was very scathing about the Iron Cross. The good lady was very depressed & wondered where they could find any enthusiasm for the war except in their papers. Things seem to be very quiet on the line near here at present. I have quite forgotten what a gun sounds like it is so peaceful. Love from Jack. ",1915-10-22,Mother
"My dear Mother, We are still at peace, though I am going up to the trenches to-morrow to look over the part we are taking over on Monday when we shall be in for a few days – probably six, & then come back here again. We are busy putting ourselves into huts & getting ourselves tucked in for the winter. We had the Army Commander round this morning inspecting us, a very cheery old boy simply covered in ribbons. I had them all out, lepers included, & I think the old thing was satisfied but he couldn't see much as he was only with us for 10 minutes. Many thanks for writing to Mrs. Fairtlough. I think she will be very glad to hear from you. I have run across a number of people round here lately whom I have known previously. It is only a village about as big as, say Banstead, but it is simply crowded with all sorts & conditions & one comes across the most unlikely blokes. Fox has been made a Staff Captain of this Brigade so we shall not lose him & it will be very useful to have a friend at court. I have been trying to get Mirfield to come here but he is going south somewhere as a Liaison Officer who is one who dwells with the French & passes on their doings to us. This means a bed & a fire & I don't blame him for taking it, if he gets the chance. Not that we aren't fairly comfortable, but I must say the bed appeals to one now, though I can sleep like a pig on the hardest of floors. Love to all from Jack ",1915-10-23,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter of the 23 received yesterday, for two of Father's also received yesterday dated the 23 & Olive's of the 22. I am awfully glad you are all learning on the pram & hope you will soon be independent of a professor. I am back again on the old canal but in a slightly different place as we are building a different section of the line. The trenches are an extraordinary maze & the line is very in & out & it is all beginning to crumble, so we are setting to work to put it up. Yesterday when we came in was a pig of a day with an easterly wind & heavy rain, & when we left camp it looked as if we were in for it but the rain stopped by the time we got in & now the wind has changed & the sun is out. However I am very grateful for the trench boots as the mud getting to the trenches is pretty bad, not quite the Shoreham kind but very adhesive. The trenches themselves are not so bad as there are duck-walks at the bottom i. e. slats of wood nailed on to planks & the water runs away underneath. Our Headquarters dug out is quite comfortable & warmer than the last as it is smaller & we have got a brazier. It is furnished with the contents of a neighbouring château (it is only a small country house but quite a bijou like place) & some of the furniture is very good. The walls of the dugout are lined with the Venetian blinds. I think I told you we were inspected by the Corps Commander last Saturday & to-morrow I have got to go back as we are to be inspected by a still greater personage. I have had a maze of instructions issued to-day as to what is to happen but I don't understand a word at present, but I suppose it will come all right on the day. I have only got a representative crowd of 20 per Battalion from this Brigade to look after. Very many thanks to father for going down to the C. O.'s memorial service. I saw from the Surrey Advertiser this week that he was there. The socks will be very welcome if you send them along. If you have things & don't know what to do with them Mrs. Elias Morgan at the Depot Guildford would take them. she runs a thing called the Queens Comforts Fund for all the Battalions of the Queens & I have got several things from her & am expecting more. Many thanks for the tongues & cake & pickles from the J. A. & N. C. S. L. I had an excellent meal last night at 2:30 a. m. after we had taken over. It is always a busy time getting settled in & one gets little sleep the first night & the tongues filled an aching void. I have now got Peter as my adjutant having very tactfully got rid of Woollatt & turned him on to command a company in Peter's place. I think the change will be a great blessing, especially to me as it relieves me of a lot of work. There was a little excitement last night a few trenches away on our right. I think someone put up a mine or two, anyhow there was a terrific rumpus everybody, guns & everything going for all they were worth for quite a long time. Our own trenches were absolutely quiet but down here we got the full benefit, as all the bullets which miss the trenches whistle over our dugout. Of course in the dug out & when under the shelter of the canal bank we are absolutely all right, but our transport was just coming up at the time & I was afraid that they would catch it all. However they came through unscathed & now all is peaceful again. I said 6 footballs before counting them, but it was 4 & they will come in very useful later on. We are starting an Institute at our Rest Camp & I suppose later on there will be concerts there & suchlike I don't know if we have any talent in the Battalion, but I must find out. The Institute is a large barn & will be a very good place when finished. I have it on my mind that some of you have asked me some questions in letters recently which I haven't answered. I am afraid I have torn up the letters, so if you want to know anything please repeat & I will try to answer. I got the Engineering paper all right, but I should prefer the Locomotive Magazine price 2d published on the 15th of each month & shall be very much obliged if someone will send it along. Please thank Cecily for her cigarettes, which are very nice. Unfortunately I am stocked with them at the moment & have more than I can get through, as I do not smoke them much. I must now cease love to all from Jack. As to the pram I don't want Jo to have it, if anyone else is using it but only when it is idle I am letting him know. ",1915-10-26,Mother
"My dear Mother, Another letter & very little news. The rain has been our trouble lately & the trenches have been tumbling to bits everywhere. The men have had to work like niggers to keep them in repair & as to-day has been fine, we have been able to get over most of the trouble. We found to-day that there is a spring under one of the parapets so there is no wonder that it won't keep up. However I have got the sappers on to it to-night & they may be able to drain the thing somehow. The weather is fairly mild & the rain has stopped so things are more comfortable but the mud in places is fairly bad especially in the part leading to the trenches before the trench actually begins. Here there is 600 yards of mud never less than 6 inches & in many places 2 feet deep & it takes a long time to pick one's way through. However no one minds mud here & my boots keep me quite dry, though I pity the ration parties etc. who have to go up & down through it. I hear that the Huns opposite us are Marines & considered very harmless. At present they are as quiet as mice & barring a little strafing by their guns from time to time there is nothing doing. I fancy neither side is very keen on leaving its line, where there are dug-outs for the doubtful advantage of a little advance & no cover. I hear our new C. O. is appointed Twigham by name & a D. S. O. He was Adj. of the 3rd Batln. just after I left. I have met him once & believe he is a very good chap. I don't know when he is going to join. We are going back to-morrow night & shall then have to carry on with our huts, which I hope our relieving battalion have been getting on with during the past week. The trouble has been to get the tools to build the things with, but these should be forthcoming by now & we may be able to do something. Then with a little rubble from Ypres (where we have to send for it though it is miles off) to make the roads & a better loot from somewhere else, if any is forthcoming we may get fairly comfortable. We have managed to get hold of a hand cart to-day & are hugely pleased & I am having our name put on in large letters lest the real owners turn up & claim it. A hand cart is a tremendous blessing to cart rations & odds & ends on & I hope we shall manage to retrieve some more before long. Of course the govmt. don't supply them as they are unauthorised transport, but the ordinary rules go by the board out here. I should like to get one of the small local carts but I haven't found an ownerless one anywhere. Of course this country has been fairly scoured by now, & there is precious little left which is of any use. They have served us out with goatskin coats to wear in the trenches, but I have not had them issued, as it is not cold enough. I believe they smell something horrid & are only for wear out of doors. In a dug-out they are too overpowering. Love to all from Jack. ",1915-10-30,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for yours, Cecily's & mother's all received to-day. As Cecily will understand, we saw Horace, looking rather ill I thought, but I told you about it in my previous efforts. Since then he has come an almighty clump off his horse, but apparently he is getting better. Young Horace looked very flourishing & well fed, but the poor lad should never walk on such occasions, as he waddles like a duck. The new C. O, Twigham by name & a D. S. O. from the 2nd Battln., turned up yesterday when in the trenches & should do us very well. He knows his job inside out. I knew him slightly before as he was adjt. of the 3rd Battln. just when I left. He is an O. C. so will appear in my register. We were relieved last night & are now back in camp resting. The camp is a sea of mud exactly like Shoreham, but as it is raining hard, they can't drag us forth to drill, so the men are actually getting a bit of rest which is more than I expected for them. I pity the regiment who has relieved us as they must be sw – I mean perspiring like little beavers to hold the blooming place up. However their Hqrs are better off than us, as they have a table & chairs & I am perforce writing this by the light of a solitary candle while at full length on my valise. Hence the more than usually undecipherable words. I am very glad the pram is in full working order. The other delicacies socks mittens or comforters have not yet arrived but I shall easily find a use for them when they do. I know to-night that one of our Sergeants has got the D. C. M. for that Hulluch business. They have given 3 to the Brigade. I must now cease, as dinner is ready & I have a Court Martial to run to-morrow & must study the particulars, & decide whether to hang draw or quarter the victims or only give them p. s. for life. Yours Jack ",1915-11-01,Father
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter received to-day & for the copy of Glad's, also for Mother's & two parcels of socks & mittens & a further parcel of eatables from yourself. I ought at this moment to be in the trenches as the Battalion we relieve was to stay in longer, but owing to the filthy weather & the rotten state of the trenches they came out early & we relieved them yesterday. I stayed behind as I am at the moment on a special job which is really policeman's work, being in charge of a number of posts on the local roads to hold up everyone & examine their passes & send in anyone who cannot account for himself satisfactorily for further examination. Of course one can't take orders too literally or half the army would now be languishing in gaol as none of them worry about passes, but we have got a civilian or two & may have more before the evening is out. It started at 9 last night & we chuck it at 9 to-night & I am going up to the trenches to-morrow I had a Divisional car to go about in & it was just as well as it took me over 5 hours last night to get round my section even in that, & a little less this morning. The roads in places are awful & it is amazing how the cars stand it, & of course some of the posts were placed, so that we could only get to them by wading through thick mud, so I had a cheery time slushing about last night. Some of the post commanders were rather too zealous & were quite prepared to arrest the G. O. C. if he appeared. One of them did arrest a Gunner brigade major & send him back for identification to Hqrs & I met him afterwards & he didn't like it a bit. However he will take a pass with him in future. As the regiment we relieve has come back into our camp, I was rather at a loss where to go when not on my rounds, but I have attached myself to our quartermaster (Who stays back here & sends up the rations from here) & am consequently very comfortable. Owing to Court Martials & arrange- ments for to-day's show I have hardly seen anything of the regiment or our new C. O. since he joined. He is a very strict disciplinarian & I am afraid will be rather too much so, as the old sort of discipline is to my mind not required by the new army, or any how not by our men. They have got enough to put up with without bothering them with small details. However we shall see how he goes on. Certainly the drafts that have come to us from the 3rd Battln. which were trained when he was adjutant are jolly good & he will wake us all up. Love to all from Jack. ",1915-11-05,Father
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for your letter of the 5th received this morning. It looks as if we are going to get the cold & frosty air you mention, which will be a good thing as we may then be able to do something to these blanky trenches. I came back two days ago & found them in a fairly rotten condition, in fact the communication trench was so bad that we could only get in & out of the fire trench by night or in the early morning mist. This was most annoying as it entailed my getting up at 5 a. m. to look round. We moved our headquarters further up the canal last night to the same ones we were in when we came here first, this alteration being made on our taking over a bit more of the line to the left & giving a bit on our right to another battalion, & our left is now on the canal aforesaid. Even to get up to our new trenches we have to get out of the communicating trench for some of the way, but it doesn't matter, as it is dead ground & the Bosch can't see us. We are being relieved again to-night & will then have to do our usual ten mile walk back. They say the Division is due to go back into Corps Reserve soon, which will mean clearing out altogether & going back into billets ten miles further away but I won't accept it, till I find myself there. In moving our headquarters, we have been able to despoil our old ones, as no one is now going to be there, so all the more solid furniture including a most marvelous hatstand & all chairs with more than 2 legs are coming up here. A pause, while we are telephoning to our batteries to strafe the Huns, who have been making themselves obnoxious by dropping whizz-bangs (so called because they whizz & bang) on our fire trenches. This done we will resume. The new headquarters are very palatial & made for a French General in times past, who must have been a very large or excitable person, as they have given him a lot of room to expand & his bedroom was palatial with a commanding view of the opposite canal bank. As a matter of fact this place is rather attractive as it is in a wood & the bull rushes are in full bloom, if they do bloom in the water & the moor hens are all over the place. Unfortunately the canal is practically empty or we might have a regatta on it. I hear the Saxons are opposite our trenches in the right & one of the men of the regiment on our right was seen to go out the other day & shake hands with a a Saxon, who had done ditto from the other side & then return. I fancy neither side will strafe the other & no one quite knows what to do. I should say that the crowd opposite here had been relieved, as the present lot are far more vicious, & at times are openly insolent. However we have bagged one or two of them & will get more as we learn their little ways. What do you think of the enclosed, which I got the other day. Love to all Jack. ",1915-11-08,Cecily
"My dear Father, I wonder if you would mind choosing a wedding present for Tommy who is being married on the 16th inst. I think a good sensible & strong (must be strong as he is a rough & ready creature) stick would be best, & if you would get it at Harrods & put it down to me there, it would be all right or I could send you a cheque. I owe you a lot now, so please do as you like. I should like an inscription. R. G. T. from H. J. C. P. with two dates 26.9.1915 16.11.1915 I will write him a line to tell him to expect it. I have just received the enclosed which may interest you. Would you keep it for me Yours Jack ",1915-11-09,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter of the 6th also for a further copy of the Autocar, & for a large parcel from the J. A. & N. C. S. L. containing eatables. I have not seen K. of K. about here though I shouldn't be surprised if he turned up to see if there is a 24th Division & if so what it is doing. They say he has gone to Russia. I saw the wireless news yesterday & it was very encouraging about Serbia. there is a wireless station close to our Brigade office & they pick it up there every night at midnight when it is sent out from Poldhu, so in this way we are kept up to date. We were relieved last night & I got back about 2 a. m. & so to bed, a perfect night for a ride only a trifle cold but the stars were magnificent. Of course this morn. more rain, which we have had to-day plus a S. E. wind so the camp is getting back into its former condition & we really hoped it was beginning to get dry. It was rather a fine effect as we came back as we had to ride parallel to the line only about 3 miles behind it & all the way along the star lights, which the Bosches send up continuously, made the place like a Brocks benefit for our partic- ular edification. By the way if you get a chance you ought to have a run in the pram to St. Martha's Guildford. They have planted trees in pots all over the roof & all round it so that the Zepps can't find it & the effect is ludicrous from the sketch I have seen. You allude to the 17th as going East. I don't know whether you mean Brigade or Division, but the 17th Division is in this village & have only rumours at present, as have among others including us, that they are going I don't myself believe that any of them will be going & I certainly hope not as there will be all the more for us to do. You would not expect to meet many new people in the trenches but it is extraordinary how people crop up. What with the Trench Mortar Man & Brigade Bombing Officers & other officials Gunner Observation Officers there is a constant stream of strangers in & out. Yesterday I found a new sort, viz. a motor machine gun officer, who having nothing else to do has been told off to strafe the Huns from eligible points behind our lines. The trench mortar man is not popular, as he only deals in things about 20 lbs in weight & having worked his works he packs up & goes off and in about1/2 hours he is answered by numerous  100 lb. bombs which we have to put up with. I am told that the average Trench Mortar Man is the most dismal being in the neighbourhood, as we all hate him so. All these officials of course are in addition to the ordinary routine of Brigade Divisional & Corps Brass hats, all of whom have something of their own to recommend. One of them told me the other day that it was curious how everyone regarded them as an inevitable nuisance, when they are only too anxious to help. Love from Jack ",1915-11-08,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for a large parcel of comestibles which I have opened to-day including a very good cake & some tinned things. As you have asked the question I think this sort of thing is better than potted meats & tinned sausages are very welcome. Nothing much doing to-day except more rain & a south easterly wind though they have been out for a little drill & route march. I had a look round our Brigade Institute to-day & it is beginning to go very well. They have started a coffee bar there & they've got a piano, so really there is very little they can want. They are also thinking of starting a Divisional band, but I can hardly imagine that it will be much of a success, as I imagine that what instruments the various regiments have got are probably in different keys. Possibly however they mean to torture the Huns with it. We have been trying to get the sappers to come along & test the water in our trenches, as if it is drinkable it will save a lot of labour in carrying water & the water will not be half petrol, but we hear to-day that they may get it done in 3 months time, so we shall have to risk it. As it drains directly out of the Bosch trench, Lord only knows what is in it, but I presume we shall find out from experience. I fear my news is drying up & there is no guide book to the trenches from which I can quote. My trouble now is that as 2nd in command to a C. O. who likes to run his own show, there is very little to do & my life at present consists mostly of mud & meals with intervals of sleep to recover from an exhausting day of doing nothing. I have heard it said that life out here consists of long periods of absolute boredom with short intervals of paralyzing terror & I am beginning with the first condition now. I must get the C. O. to allot me some definite job. Love to all Jack. ",1915-11-10,Father
"My dear Cecily, Thanks for your & Odd's letters to-day. I find I want my British Warm as a long coat in this camp gets so fearfully muddy. Would you mind sending it off. We are moving camp to-morrow & going up about 5 miles. I don't quite know why but presume they want a Battalion to be in reserve nearer by than at present. We don't go into the trenches for 3 or 4 days. I don't think the move is to be permanent as we are leaving our Quartermaster here with the usual concomitants & I take it that we shall return here when we come out next time. I have just had a very pleasant bath in a beer tub & feel comparatively clean. Yours Jack. ",1915-11-11,Cecily
"My dear Mother, Another letter to let you know that we have moved, as I mentioned in my last letter. We are now in billets in a village about 4 miles from the trenches & have quite a substantial roof over our heads though the house lacks furniture. For some reason best known to himself the Hun has not demolished the place, though many of the houses in the main street have ceased to exist. The only thing which has really suffered is the church, chiefly because of its tower I suppose. Anyhow the tower has gone & the church is closed. We have had another perfectly filthy day with lots of rain, though the wind was S. W. and therefore warm. They say that they have not had such weather for a long time & the roads in places are awful. The motor lorries are not allowed to leave the pavé, as the moment they do they go in above their axles in mud, so we all have to leave the centre of the road to them. I saw one to-day which had got off the pavé & it looked as if nothing on earth would get it out. I hear they are sending a lot of the lorries away presumably to [Servia] & are going to rely on horse transport as the timbers are much lighter & will stand more knocking about. I invested in a Primus stove yesterday to warm the tent & nearly blew the thing to bits, but when I got it working, it did very well & we went to bed in a tropical heat. It will be very useful in a dug-out later on provided that I can get the oil for it, but there are means of getting that from time to time, so I hope to be able to keep it going. My only fear is that all this rain will undermine our dug-outs & it will be very interesting to know whether we shall have a roof over our heads or not when we go up. The caught a Bosch deserter up our way the other day, who says that that in places in their trenches they are up to their shoulders in water so they are as badly off as we in that respect anyhow. Yours Jack. P. S. In sending me parcels, I believe that if you put ""On Active Service"" on them they come cheaper. ",1915-11-12,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for yours of the 11th received yesterday also for the promise of a ham. We have now got the mess on a better footing and are getting things regularly from the Field Force Canteen, so please do not worry to send things in future or any how so prolifically as there is no reason why the mess should feed at your expense. Still I would not say that an occasional little trifle would not be acceptable. We were warned at 2 hours notice to relieve trenches last night & we came in late in consequence. I got in presumably about 1:30 by the chief reason for the delay was the activity of the Huns in shelling the main road which hung up all the transport & reliefs in the district for a good hour or more & yet they did no damage except to some houses & trees by the roadside. We are going for them tonight I believe with every gun in the neighborhood as the Bosches have been getting rather uppish with their skills lately & want to be put in their place. The guns are beginning now (5:30 p.m.) & the shells big & little are whistling away far overhead, while we are quite comfortable under the lea of a hill & quite secure from everything which does not drop direct from the skies. Unfortunately our fine trenches are not so protected, so they may retaliate on the, which they are rather fond of doing. I don't think I should let you know exactly where we are in the trenches but from the indications I have given with regard to the canal should help you as I only know of one round here. The rest camp is at a place beginning with R ʌ5 miles south of a town beginning with P which I have already mentioned. yesterday I had to conduct 2 M.P.s round our billets They were brought up by one of the staff to be shown round the trenches, but owning to the shelling aforesaid he did not dare risk their valuable lives by taking them into the trenches so he compromised by showing them the men in billets. I took them round & I think opened their eyes a bit as I am not sure they did not expect to find each man in a bed, whereas they were all together in such houses as had not been absolutely smashed to bits & some sort of roof or upper floor still standing & mostly in pitch darkness except for candles, as of course there is no glass left in these villages near the trenches owing to its being broken by concussion & the windows are blocked up to keep out the balmy breezes However they are doing in such places & it is marvelous how cheery they are. I was a little too early with the, as about an hour afterwards the place was shelled & we had to get the men out. However they didn't hit the house or do any damage at all. I expect this shelling business will get a little heavier now as the leaves are off the trees, or it may be that they have got some new batteries up, but it has been much more noticeable lately. It might be that it is in reply to our own, as our people don't appear to stint the ammunition nowadays & loose off whenever they've a mind to. I hear that the Munition Ministry has not yet sent a single shell out, so when theirs begin to arrive the bally guns will get red hot in trying to loose it all off. To revert to the M.P.s one was a Unionist a [condescending sot], of course, who thought he was conferring a favour on the men by coming to see them & the other a Labour M.P. I forget their names. The Unionist was rather like the M.P. in Stalking & Co. who went to talk to the boys. They both certainly knew nothing whatever about soldiering & the one in question had some rotten ideas to propose which I proceeded to squash at once. I take it that we shall be here for a week before we clear out & I think it will be not so bad, if the weather holds up. It was glorious to-day though cold & freezing a bit, in fact it was possible to get in last night over the mud without going in very deep. Many thanks for your subscription to the Plum Pudding fund & also for taking so much trouble about the license. By the way, it occurs to me that Trustee Stocks must depreciate now that govmt. loans are being issued at 4 ½ & 5% unless they are in something reasonable at par. I don't want to make any alteration, but it should be considered for my Trustee Stocks. What do you think? Yours Jack ",1915-11-15,Father
"My dear Family Thank you very much for all your letters. Mothers, Fathers Cecily's, & Odds & also for copies of g's for an excellent ham. Also for ordering the stick for Tommy. I am sorry I forgot his address. Also for London Opinion from Cecily, this on several occasions & the Autocar from Mother. We are still in the trenches and are to remain now till Monday when I believe the Division is going back into reserve for a short time, but this is why the present intent is & will probably be altered dozens of times before the day. The weather is cold but there is a little less rain & we are beginning to get the trenches into some sort of order again. I have been round once or twice lately by night & before dawn & it has been perfect as we are in the top of a slight rise & as the moon has been very bright there has been a fine view. By day one gets a very good view from behind our trenches over a very large expanse of that country. I am v. glad to hear G&W are coming home, as they ought to have a respite from their uncivilized existence for a bit. We get all the sandbags we want now & the only difficulty is to fill them as the only ingredients we have are mud & water or ice according as they are filled by day or night. I enclose a letter from G. which explains how she got fever & I hope you will strafe her according. I am afraid Father is having a bad time with all his clerks away. I hope the female element are coming up to the scratch. There is nothing much doing here at the moment they are stirring up the Hun with all the machine guns we have in the neighborhood. I doubt if it is of any use & we shall probably get some infernal machines thrown back at us in return, but by that time the Brigade Machine Gun officer who arranged the show will have gone back to bed. We shall have to institute a rule that these officials who do these things stay on in the trenches for an hour or two after they have finished to see what sho sort of gifts are sent us in return. As a matter of fact they have just started shelling the front lines somewhere up our way & I hope they are near the B.M.G.O Love from Jack. P.S. G. appears to want a photo of me. Is there one she can have?",1915-11-18,Family
"My dear Family, I can actually write you a letter without having anything to acknowledge. The mail has failed to arrive today, so that is probably the reason, still I feel quite virtuous in getting a letter off in the circumstances. There is no news. Weather fine & cold & a gorgeous moonlight night which will probably mean a frost. Very unpleasant in the early morn when I am woken at 5 a.m. to toddle round. It is quite extraordinary how I get up at such an unearthly hour quite gratuitously. Some of the officers of the Battalions who are relieving us have been here to-day to look round & more will be coming to-morrow. We strafed the Hun pretty fairly last night & this morning, as he was supposed to be relieving a deserter having come over a little way down the line the other day & said so, but I doubt if we did any good unless the guns caught him in the woods behind. The deserters when they come are very useful & give a lot of information. The Huns have had a lot of aeroplanes over lately & there have been a few fights in the air, but nothing really exciting & in fact they have been rather left to themselves. I have just got your letters in spite of all. Mothers of the 18th & Cecily's of the 17th both very interesting. What luck for Odd to go North. I am so glad Cecily can manage the pram alone. Yours Jack ",1915-11-20,Family
"My Dear Mother, Many thanks for your & Cecily's letters, which I hereby acknowledged last night. Why they are billeting men at Carshalton I can't understand as there is nowhere to move about in the open. However I suppose the Epsom & Sutton people had fought billeting last year so now it is your turn. I expect your enthusiasm will die down before long, but you appear to have received them royally. What I remember of Reigate, what we most appreciated was being on the ground floor where the orderleys could get in & out without worrying the household & having breakfast on trays in our room while dressing before going on parade & what we objected to was not having a fire in our own room & being expected to live with the household in the evenings, but that depends largely on the household & the billetees & you have probably solved the problem by now whether you want them or not. Another very cold day but dry & very quiet though they appear to be having a show up the salient on our left somewhere. I don't think it was much or we should have heard about it. The place you mention was where we were billeted for 2 days last week before coming in to the trenches. So your billetee may be able to let you know whereabouts I am. We have just got a new subaltern from the H.A.C. which has become an Officers Training Corps. Odd ought to have no end of a time at Invergordon though what she knows of Badminton I can't imagine However if she buys a book of the rules, she ought to know something by the time she gets there as it takes a longish while to get up as far as that these days. I am glad the pram is of some use and hope you & C are still whole after driving to Cheam. I thought someone said that there was something broken in the cylinders. If so, has it been repaired or is it one of these little things which don't matter. Congratulations to H.V.P. on becoming a Sergeant & donning the yellow garter. I hope it doesn't mean more work & I am afraid it will be duller than ordinary constabulary duty. Perhaps they will let him do his rounds in the pram. We are going back into France very shortly I don't know where exactly but somewhere behind & will stay there as at present arranged for about a month & then I suppose we shall come up in this direction again. Love to all Jack ",1915-11-21,Mother
"My dear Cecily. Many Thanks for your & Mothers last letters. Also for some Daily Graphics, the Autocar & Loco. Magazine. The Daily Graphics I can see here, so please do not trouble about them. I have also had a cake & other things to∙day from, the Junior Army & Navy, for which very many thanks. The cake is very good, but with regard to the other things they amount at present to a superfluity of riches as we are well supplied with such things from the Local Field Force Canteen. We are at the moment on the move and weights are consequently reduced to a minimum. The Division is on its way back into Corps Reserve. We were relieved in the trenches on Monday night by a Battalion of the New Division & then went back to our camp. It was an exhilarating walk from my point of view, as the horse was slipping all over the place owning to the frost & eventually it became so bad that I had to get off & lead him. He at once proceeded to collapse & repeated the occurrence twice afterwards once catching me an almighty crump on the leg with his forefoot. The following day – yesterday – we spent in our very muddy camp & left in the evening for a 12 mile march here, Steenvoorde. (there is no harm in mentioning this as we are off again to-morrow) Quite a serviceable French Country town & the people seem very affable. The men are in Farms billets & the Hqr. Staff in the house of the local tanner & his wife who are doing us very well. The tannery business has ceased owning to the war, so the good man can attend to our wants while his lady does the cooking. I got a very good bed last night which is a great luxury as I don't think I've had one for six weeks, & found it very hard to get up this morning. I don't know yet where we are going to be these next few weeks & if the Huns propose to be offensive, as I see from the papers they do, we may have to go back within range again, but at present we we can look on the war with disinterested eyes. We can only just hear the guns & can see an observation balloon in the distance otherwise we might be anywhere. The country is not so deadly flat here & things are not so fearfully dull & depressing. I think Reninghelst was the most dreary place I was ever in, but there is much more colour about everything here. We have no Interpreter with us & as not one of the others known more than oui & non in the language I have to do all the interpreting & am getting along swimmingly, thanks to Mdlle Gouget. I was much amused to-day at the way the flying corps manage their things. Of course the ordinary way of getting [water?] in a horse-drawn wooden cart at 2 m.p.h would be much too slow for them, so they have taken its wheels off & put on others with rubber tyres & charge over the country with it behind a light lorry at 30 m.p.h. Most efficient down here but they couldn't do it on the roads further up. I hear that French is going to address the Division to explain that he didn't realise how it had been jiggered about, when he wrote his last report, though I should have thought that someone might have told him before he wrote it. However we have not got the address yet & it may be all wind. I must now cease to catch the post. Love to all Jack. ",1915-11-24,Cecily
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for your letter written the day of my departure, and also for letters from Mother & Father & yourself written before I went on leave & various papers. As I told you I don't think the men need daily papers as they get them one way and another, but the others are always welcome. We had an uneventful journey to Folkestone, though I began to get qualms as we got nearer the sea & the rain fell and wind blew. The boat was one of the Stranraer ones & rather smaller than the usual lot, & rolled considerable. I got a place downstairs to lie on, so I was all right though I expected at any moment to be up & doing. I think they were afraid that mines had got loose, as we were all given life-belts & told to wear them. We got to Boulogne at 7.15 & then found that there was no train on, so we put up there for the night & came on here at 1 p.m the next day. We got to St. Omer at 5.15 (20 miles as the crow flies) & then by bus here at 7 p. m. The hotel at Boulogne was quite comfortable & they fed us well & did not burgle us at the end. I think the journey up was the dullest I have ever done, as we were pulled up at every signal on the way up. Our billet here is quite comfortable, with a bed for me & a good room downstairs. The home is a good size & owned by two maiden ladies, whom I have not seen, but who are very anxious to do their best. The C. O. tries to cope with them but his French is not sufficient so I shall be turned on. We mess in an Estaminet close by. The country is very wet, as there has been a lot of rain. I send this by Peter Bye, who goes on leave to-morrow morning. Fossey is also going and as he will be in town I have told him to call at 17 Albemarle St. so Father may see him. I must stop now Love from Jack. ",1915-12-06,Cecily
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for yours & Cecily's letters of the 2nd which I have just received. Also for Richard Carvil, which I am reading & like very much & Quinney's from Cecily which I have not had time to start yet. We moved from our last billet on Tuesday, leaving the home at 4.45 a. m, which, you will appreciate, suited me down to the ground as I always was an early riser. We had a 3 hour journey by train, which sounds long but which was really only about 30 miles & then we marched to our rest camp in this area, which we shall use when we come out of the trenches. It is only about a mile from our old one, where we were before we went back. The new one is an appalling place as regards mud & we had a bad time the first night, as we never got into touch with our transport till about 10 at night & consequently got nothing to eat. Yesterday we moved up into dug outs within a mile or two of the line & we stay here for a few days, till it is our turn to go right in & then we have a few days there & then we go back to the rest camp for more & then repeat. The dug outs we are in now are very good. Quite new & dry. The objection is that we are surrounded by batteries which loose off fairly continuously & they are all big guns, so they make the deuce of a noise. We are in the grounds of a chateau which is reputed to belong to a Hun, whom the Belgians got rid of early in the war as a spy. Anyhow true or not, so far the Hun has spared the chateau & I trust he will continue so to do. I am in quite a comfortable hut with a bedstead – but no mattress, but it is inclined to be chilly as it is made of canvas. However it promises well, as we have had a terrific gale with rain & nothing seems to have come through. Our difficulty is to get anything cooked, as we have no store & as I am doing the housekeeping, I have to care for these things. I hear to-day that the Hun has proposed peace thro' the Rothschilds & the story gives the exact terms so I don't believe a word of it. Everyone seems to think that they're getting fed up & all down the line we seem to be going out in parties dropping bombs on them, but they very rarely come over & drop bombs on us. Some people think that they are going back from this bit of the line, so as to make theirs shorter, but I devoutly hope they don't, as we shall have nowhere to live if we follow them. I think Reggie Dane is up near here somewhere. I heard that some of his Division were in the train for Egypt after having got rid of all their kit, & then they were hauled out again. Rather hard luck when they were all expecting a pleasant winter season in Cairo. Love to all from Jack. ",1915-12-07,Mother
"My dear Odd, Very many thanks for your & Cecily's letters received to-day. I am very busy just now as Peter Bye is at home & I am doing his job, which in addition to my own (small though it is) has not left me much time to myself. All Tuesday I was on a Court Martial condemning the unfortunates to death by slow torture in batches. It was a long process & took all day much to the annoyance of our billet-holders, who couldn't put the cart away as we were sitting in their coach house – and the cart was outside getting soaking wet. Yesterday I went on a tour round the army district & saw various places like supply railheads, ammunition railheads, engineering stores & such like. Quite interesting but rather hurried They gave us a very good lunch at Army Hqrs. & afterwards we were shown the working of the whole thing. The intelligence branch was the most interesting, & they showed us a map which had evidently been blown out of the a Bosch aeroplane, & which told us a lot. I noticed that they only had our trenches, where we were, only fairly accurately marked & they map explained why they were continually shelling certain places, which did us no conceivable sort of harm & only wasted their ammunition, these points being shown as important on the map. I don't know why they took us round except to show that they do some work & don't spend all their time playing bridge, & they all seemed to wish to impress us with the amount they have to do – quite unnecessarily I thought, as I know that they are very busy. We went in motor charabancs & spent about 5 or 6 hours in them on the way, so I had quite enough of them at the end as they are not too comfortable. In the evening I went with the C. O to dine with the General, who gave us a very good dinner. We have started a concert hall here & there was a concert on last night but the talent is not very great, except the Methodist parson, who sings well. Rain & wet to-day & I have been in, but chiefly not because of the wet but on account of work. I hear now that when we go up next time we shall be on the North side of the salient instead of the South, but it may not be correct. If we are I think we shall be on the canal somewhere near where we join the French. I expect the carburettor needle stuck, when Cecily got held up on the pram. Do you know how to tickle it properly – if not Wardill will show you. I had a little from Mrs. Cressy yesterday – she is down at Bexhill. Love to all Jack. ",1915-12-09,Glad
"My dear Mother, I fear I have omitted to write for 3 days but must plead work as my excuse. Fiddling little jobs mostly sending off parties woodcutting or digging or in one thing & another which keep one constantly employed. Friday was as usual a vile day. Yesterday ditto but warm & to-day dry but durned cold, so we have heated the furnace seven times hotter than usual & shut all windows & doors & frowsted generally. The old ladies do us quite well in the coal line & I find a hot brick in bed every night, so I do not expect to perish of frost bite. We had a short route march yesterday in the rain to be inspected by the G. O. C. 2nd. Army, who appeared to be satisfied with the brigade & in the afternoon a shooting competition to decide the Company team to fire in a Brigade shooting thing this afternoon. It was run thus – two teams run along side each other & over obstacles for about 300 yards & then blaze away at tiles which represent the the opposing team. As each tile is knocked out the corresponding man of the other team ceases fire. Quite interesting to watch. The 1st. North Staffs. won easily, as they were on their own range, which was over a chalk pit & rather a difficult place to range over & secondly all their team were regulars. None of the new army Battalions had a look in, as was only to be expected. We went to church in our Concert Hall – now called the Cinema Hall as the Division have purchased a Cinema Machine somewhere which we shall cart about with us. I don't quite know who runs it, but I think the Provost Marshal, anyhow he hasn't got it working yet & when he does it will probably run upside down. Frossard has got something to do with it as the Methodist padre is on leave – so it is a cert. to be a failure. We send Barry home on leave this week to get married. I fancy that Jo is to be hauled out to do best man, as it is considered that his limp will do better credit to the proceedings, but I fear that he will have got over it by then, so he will have to cultivate it afresh. When I get a moment, I must get in to St. Omer to have a bath, as I've not had one since I left & one can't go unwashed for ever. The people here apparently do not bathe & it is a good thing as there is only one domestic & she apparently does the cooking & house work & in addition looks after the pony, cleans the cart & feeds the fowls. In her spare moments she gardens, so if she had to empty bath water as well, I take it that the livestock would perish. Another peculiarity I notice is that the household pump is in direct communication with the cesspool, which no doubt gives the drinking water a flavor of its own. Luckily we dont mess here, but I am beginning to fight shy of cleaning my teeth. The plum puddings which Father helped to purchase have arrived & were much appreciated. They were eaten at once, as we don't know when we are to move though they say now that we shall be here over Christmas If so, much the better. Love from Jack. ",1915-12-12,Mother
"My dear Family, I am much obliged for letters from Mother Cecily & Olive received on Sunday or Monday. I think I wrote last on Sunday, since when things have run a normal course. On Sunday we fired our tie in the Tile competition against the 1st. I. V. Staffs, but they were much too good for our blokes & in addition were firing on their own range. On Monday we had a route march Yesterday we got up a cross country run about 1 ½ miles to select a team to go in for an inter. battalion show later on. We got about 150 to start & about a half finished. I started them & kept with them & came in first, but as I had the sense to go on horse-back it didn't count. To-day we had some rather dull lectures on machine guns, but they didn't tell us anything new One of the Divisional Staff was worth watching, as he went obviously to sleep & then woke up with a start, hastily made a note in a large book & then went to sleep again. The Staff surpass themselves sometimes. We have lately dug some trenches here which are copies of a German trench somewhere & are supposed to be typical – the idea being that when dug we should practise attacking them. As time is limited we have only dug them about 2 ft. deep & of course it is no use practicing an attack when you can see what everyone else is doing, to practicing one in trenches 8 ft. deep when you can see nothing. So the staff brilliantly suggest that the men should pull their caps over their eyes and be told put on their honour not to look around them. I think this is the G. O. C.'s brilliant idea & having given birth to it, he has gone on leave to recover & I don't blame him. Peter Bye has returned to-night so I shall resume my normal function's to-morrow, when we are going to be gassed in a trench to see what its like Lets hope my helmet tube gas G. S. No 1 hasn't got a hole in it Love to all Jack. ",1915-12-15,Family
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for yours to-day. I return the list of rings & should like No 53, large size very much. I wonder if someone would send me out from time to time a novel or two. Not fat or expensive ones, as I cannot take them about with me but an occasional 7d or 1/- one by decent authors would be very welcome. We went out to be gassed to-day, but of course the staff failed to get him there, so we live another day. They are going to try again to-morrow & with luck they may bring it off. Otherwise the day has passed without event. I go to dine with B Company to-night who have killed the fatted calf in honour of Barry, who goes home to be married to-morrow, so we shall do our best to send him off with a good head-ache. The Doctor is going off, I am glad to say, to Rouen to-morrow & I shall take the mess out of his hands. I think the C. O has wanted him to go ever since he came & has now managed to bring it off. He is so excessively slack that we can't do worse with our new one whoever he may be. Meanwhile we shall have a temporary one from the Brigade Field Ambulance. I had a letter from G. to-day. I expect she will be pretty glad to get home, as the perpetual presence of Bill is getting to much for her I fancy. So you have avoided the presence of the new C. O. I thought they would be unlikely to turn out the two you had got used to, to put him in. You will feel quite lost without a Box or Cox about the place especially that Odds gone as well. Peter Bye has returned not unaccompanied by a fat Turkey, which has developed a most curious shape, as he came in a square box. Anyhow we shall be all right for Xmas, if the cook can manage him. The companies have now got small Canteens running for the men. They buy things from the Field Force Canteen at St. Omer, & sell them at cost price to the men. They are much appreciated by the men, as practically nothing they want can be bought here. The old ladies of the place are very anxious to know if we are comfortable & when we are going but of course we mayn't tell them. One of the ladies produced a photo. of a pretty gallant young Officer of the Charlie Dingwall type, who is supposed to resemble me & I fear I didn't take it so enthusiastically as I ought. The poor fellow looked as if he would burst. You will be interested to hear that the handmaiden has now dug up the whole of the front garden & is now sowing Tulips at the back She had some trouble with the pony this morning while working on him with the currycomb & the chickens are getting obstreperous & break out of the paddock on to the tulip seeds. Otherwise her life is normal. My servant has unfortunately gone sick, so I have no one to wash & mend me at the moment, but I get my hot brick in bed by some mysterious agency, the handmaiden I expect. Love from Jack.

"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for your letter and the Illustrated London News. For your future guidance 6d of Bystander Sketch or Tatler is worth 2/- of the I. L. N. as the latter is full of war pictures which no one looks at here; there is too much of the blooming war already. Please thank Mother for the Autocar, which also arrived to-day. It was the 4th December issue, so it has been in the post some time, but I fancy all the mails are anyhow at the moment owing to Xmas. We have had to send a man or two in to the Railhead to help sort them – so evidently they are in need of help. We were all gassed to-day to see what it's like. We had to walk through a trench full of gas & phosferous fumes, but because of the gas helmets everyone has, it was almost impossible to know there was any gas there. The helmets are made of flannel with two goggle eyes and a tube mouthpiece, and are not very uncomfortable to wear except for the smell of the chemicals in them. My own is obviously made out of an old pair of pyjamas with a very tasty pattern in light blue with little flowrets & I look rather well in it, at least I am told so. My own opinion after seeing two Battalions so dressed is that I have never seen a more ridiculous set of objects in my life, but needs must where the Hun drives. There is no news. The doctor departed to-day with no outward signs of emotion displayed either by himself or us & we await the arrival of his successor. I hope you get something decent in the way of a new billet, if such arrives. Love to all Jack. P. S. Don't trouble to send this on to Odd, as I've written here some rubbish which is very similar. ",1915-12-17,Cecily
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter of the 16th & for the copy of Glad's. One begins to realise that she soon will be back, if she doesn't want any letters after the 26th. To-day being the sawbath, there has not been much doing. Church this morning in the Cinema, but I didn't go & went for a ride instead. In the afternoon a football match between the Transport & bombers of the Battalion, which was quite exhilarating. I wonder if they are meditating another Zepp raid. From the papers there have been lots o f reports of Zeppelin's being brought down & why did they risk one the other day in attempting to get over Paris? I should like to think that the Zepps are no good. Our Belgian Brigade Interpreter has just come back from his leave at Paris full of joy. Apparently he is mixed up with those who are in the know, bankers & such like & they all say there that the Hun is v. nearly done & that he will make peace terms in the spring, but we have heard this before. I have not heard much said one way or the other about French's retirement. They all say the new man is very good – I expect he will deplete the numbers of wasters on the personal staff & I hope will send them back to do a little regimental duty. They were the ones Lord St. Davids was getting at. We are busy studying the details of our new line. I think it is probably the same bit as Barney McCausland was in, only I don't know the number of his Division. The names of the trenches & farms certainly smack of Yorkshire. The Huns did a gassing stunt up in the salient this morning, but they didn't attack after it & no one seems to know why. They did no damage to us by their gas & as their was no attack, things are as they were. Perhaps they gassed themselves. Love to all Jack. ",1915-12-19,Father
"My dear G. Many thanks for your letter of the 7th. November which I got yesterday I suppose this is the last letter you will get from me before you sail for home sweet home & 5 months 10 days without Bill. I had a week at home at the beginning of the month & should be getting my next about the time you are due to arrive, so you must let them know at home when you sail, so that I can time my arrival with your own. We have been back behind the line now for nearly a month & I think they are going to let us stay here till after Xmas when we shall move up to face the Bosch again – only in a different place. I heard this morning that they had loosed off a lot of gas in the very spot we are going to, but for some reason or other didn't follow it up with an attack, so nothing happened & no one minded. Still if they gas us now, they may do so again. We were practicing in a gas trench the other day & it is extraordinary how the gas helmets protect you - & it was not a fake as they gassed one man pretty badly whose helmet was not working right. I am in a very comfortable billet here with a feather bed & a large sitting room with an open fire & two very nice old ladies to look after me. The only thing is that there is no bath & the sanitary arrangements are to say the least Nigerian. I also notice that the household pump leads direct into the household cesspool, so I drink beer. As you have heard I expect, we have got a new C. O. from our 2nd. Battn. Still under the War Office rules, anyone who acts as C. O. for more than 30 days, gets made a temporary Lt. Col. & reverts when a new C. O. arrives, so for 5 blissful days you had a brother who was a Lt. Colonel & didn't know it – poor girl what you missed. Love to the incubus Jack. ",1915-12-19,Glad
"My dear Family, My best wishes to you all for Xmas, as I imagine this ought to reach you about then. We have had our Turkey as we were not sure that it or we would keep till Saturday, but it is now certain that we don't move till later & we shall not then go into the trenches at once but wait for the first relief. Yesterday I spent mostly going to & from St. Omer, as we had ordered a lot of stuff from the Expedit- ionary Force Canteen for the men & I had to go & check it. St. Omer is quite a big place – Cathedral etc. & swarms of padres, British, - Major General Padrés & Colonel ditto. ad lib. I always wondered before where they came from – evidently this is the place. They all seemed very busy doing nothing, though I daresay some of them were on the same kind of errand as myself. To-day I was on a Court Martial & ^ we worked off five, but were evidently in a lenient mood, as I don't think anyone got more than 1 year's hard labour Our Lofting has returned to the Battalion looking none the worse for his bullet holes. He turned up with a draft yesterday & as I hear they are sending us another draft we shall be up to strength again before long. We had a football match this afternoon in a Divisional Competition between the best Companies of each Battn. We had to play the North Staffs. but they were much too good, as our fellows were a very scratch lot & they had some really good players. Love & best wishes from Jack. ",1915-12-21,Family
"My dear Mother, I cannot acknowledge any letters, as we have had no post for 3 days, the reason I suppose being Xmas parcels etc being sent up to the front & we are left without any. Probably we shall have a weeks post in one on Sunday & have to take everything along with us as we move up on Monday – by train I hope & expect. We shall be in reserve for the first few days & then move up into the front line turn & turn about, probably for some continuous time. The last few days have passed very normally. We had the Brigade Cross country run on Wednesday which was quite entertaining to watch, but our team were only second. To-day we have taken the Cinema Hall all the afternoon & evening & the men are having a concert to-night. The Field Ambulance has collared the hall for their Xmas dinner to-morrow & we have had difficulty in getting places for the men to feed in to-morrow. We are giving them 50 centimes per man out of the Regimental funds to spend on their dinners & they are out to have no end of a feed. Someone has got a pig & endless ducks etc & what with the Daily News ½ lb. of Xmas pudding & a larger meat ration than usual, it is as well that we dont move on the 26th. inst. I had a lot of trouble to-day with the proprietress of a local café as she would ^ not let us her rom, but after getting the Interpreter on to her & then the Maire who was not helpful & I am consequently reporting, we got it though I am not sure who won; as we've got to pay 10 frs for it. Our mules have all been provided with gas helmets now though I haven't seen them wear them yet. As mules eat anything & everything, I don't suppose they will last long though they must be very indigestible. It is a fact that every mule we have has eaten his headstall at least twice & the posts they are tied to have to be armour- plated with old biscuit tins to preserve them. We had a lecture yesterday on our new trenches by one of the Divisional Staff whom we are relieving. The good man did his best to depress us & pointed out at great length all their disadvantages, but some of our fellows who have been up there say that they are no worse than the previous ones we were in, & though they may be a trifle damp, so were our last ones. I rather fancy that the ground behind is marshy, but that won't affect us so much. Love to all from Jack. ",1915-12-24,Mother
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks to you and Father for the ring which arrived to-day & which I like very much indeed. It fits quite A-1. We have not had a riotous Xmas, but we got one old & one new post in & there are still several more days posts to come in. I had a present of Ian Hay's book the 1st 100,000 without any sign as to whom it came from but I suspect Father, so please thank him. It is very good reading & not a bit exaggerated. The part of the Loos show they were in was a bit to the North of Hulluch & they went in on the Saturday morning whereas we didn't arrive till later on. We had rather a shock to-day as they threatened to move our transport to-day instead of to-morrow so there were very hurried packings but they changed their minds & it is all to go to-morrow & we the day after. We had a Battalion concert last night which was quite a good show & there was much more talent than I expected. One of the old performers turned up quite unexpectedly, as he had only rejoined with the last draft after the Loos business & no one realised that he had not come back. We go into billets to start with next week & take our turn later in the line. the town's name begins with P. so you must guess the rest. They have just chucked an intricate case at my head for a Court Martial to-morrow, so I must get it up as there is lots of evidence very badly written. Rather serious too as it is a charge of stealing £30. We have got our Xmas dinner at Hqrs. on to-night Roast goose & other luxuries also some shortbread which Odd has sent. Apparently she has been dining & playing absurd games with Jellicoe himself, so far as I can gather from the mysterious allusions in her letter. I hear you are having an aerodrome at Wallington. I hope the homeless soldiers dinner party has gone off all right to-day. I had Fathers letter about the to-day & am returning the receipt to him. Yours & love to all Jack. ",1915-12-25,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for a box of very good cigars, for your half of the ring & for Ian Hay's book. Also for the proceeds of the Reversion Company, the receipt for which I return. Please invest the proceeds in War Loan & make it up to £100 stock. I enclose my cheque in blank for the amount. undated I think this will be better than waiting to see if the I. R. people give up any of their claim & if they do I can then decide (an interruption while the new C in C comes into the billet to show himself off the hand that is writing this is still warm from his grasp; he has stayed less than a minute & he with his glittering constellation of attendants has disappeared) what is to be done with their leavings. Needless to say after all preparations for our departure on Sunday night to catch the 1.50 a.m express for the front, the whole thing has been cancelled & we are still here & they have apparently not yet decided what to do with us. The latest rumour is that we are for Hooge, which is a horrible spot I'm told & they shoot at you from behind as well as in front, but it is only a rumour & quite likely to be absolutely wrong. Yesterday in spite of its being the sawbath, I had a long day with my burglars on the F. G. C. M. but finished them off in the evening. This morning we had a route march, almost 10 miles and the Brigade is being inspected to-morrow by the Divisional G. O. C. I had a letter from Ernie telling me all about your drive. I expect your trouble was the valve spindle too, & that the pram will be quite all right now the spindle is mended. Cecily told me that you had a bit of a cold, but I hope it is all right now. From Odd's letters I gather that she has dined with Jellicoe on the Iron Duke & plays rat-tat with him & other brass hats round the state room table afterwards & that she has also been shewn over the Queen Elizabeth & is acquainted with all sorts of secrets about the Dardanelles business. Love to all Jack. ",1915-12-27,Father
"My dear Father, Many thanks for yours of the 23rd & copies of Gs letters. I am much obliged for these though I am afraid it is a great labour getting them out. Also thanks of the Pern Mine Report. It reads well enough but it doesn't look as though there will be any returns yet awhile, though I am in two minds whether to send them something & take up a few more shares, as I should want to kick myself if the thing turned up trumps, but one is suspicious of mines, especially in that country, where they have an earthquake or rebellion fairly frequently, I imagine. And I don't see how they are going to solve the labour question. I am writing to the Company to find out their answers to these points. We are still here, & my billet owners say we are not going to move till the 6th inst. though how the dickens they know seeing that neither we nor the brigade know passes my comprehension. However they are quite confident about it. The C. O. had the battalion out this morning in the field, as the G. O. C. has told us to do extended order work. I don't know if the good man imagines we are going to stroll through the Hun line into the open country beyond, but I don't think its very likely, anyhow not at present. There is no news otherwise Yours Jack. ",1915-12-29,Father
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for your last & for a Tatler. Also for two reprints of Kiplings Articles which I was very glad to have. We are still where we was & show no signs of movement. We had a little excitement yesterday as our mess corporal went mad & chased the signalling subaltern through a barbed wire fence, with heavy loss. It won't do the S. S. any harm, as he is a bit of obnoxious & I was quite cheered to see him to-day with his face tied up in bandages. The mess corporal, who is really the most harmless of beings & is only a mess corporal, because he has shown signs of nerve strain before, has now returned to hospital, from which he writes gaily that he soon hopes to be back again but not if I know it. He would probably poison us. The trouble is that I can't get a substitute & though we have a chef & a butler both highly suitable they are both otherwise employed, the chef being a sergeant bomber, so I won't be allowed to collar him. I have sent in a substitute to St. Omer to-day to do our weeks shopping armed with 120 francs, Lord only knows what he will bring back. Our last mess corporal, who is by trade an actor & recites dismal monologues at the Battalion Concerts, was a bit of a cook in his way & the least solid of our patisserie was sketched by his deft fingers. The substitute is obviously a stone mason by trade, so I expect that our digestions will suffer. Smith, Transport Smith, has just come back from Hazebrouck where he learnt that the 24th Division have refused to take over a line of trenches & have been sent back to England, so now you know where I am though I had no idea of it myself. We have just got a new officer, one of the many subalterns, ^ to whom they have nothing at home to give to keep them quiet. We are overstrength as it is, but I don't mind as he has come after I have had my leave so wont have to come in before my next one. Love to all Jack.",1915-12-31,Cecily
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter enclosing the cutting from the Herald which arouses considerable interest. I am glad you got such good seats at the Memorial Sevice. They have gassed us again, but with no material success and they didn't attempt to attack, but it was pretty thick while it lasted. Really one might as well live in a gas-works as this place -- we've hardly got straight after the last show. Personally I was out of the whole thing except that I was ready at any moment to take up reinforcements if required and luckily they did not want us. Luckily because the old Bosch was putting a barrage of shrapnel on several points on the way up and I am the last person to want to go out walking through a barrage. From what I can see of the line I think the Hun must have gassed himself as well as us as he has burnt the ground all round his trenches as much as round ours. However this show is nothing like as big as the last and by this time we are quite used to it. Everything has been very quiet since, and we are coming out to-night, as the men want a bit of a rest and gas tries them rather hard. The Times I see says that things are going to be busy up here, so if the Hun gets going, it may mean that I won't be able to get back by the 16th prox. However I will do my best. Love to all Jack.

"My dear Mother, Many thanks for a copy of the Autocar and to Cecily for two papers the L. O. and P. S. all of which arrived to-day. Yesterday and to-day have been very quiet and I have been indoors most of the time as it has rained persistently. We had a concert on last night in the local cinema and managed to raise one or two respectable performers, though most of them were pretty rotten. We have now heard that we are to move in the middle of this week and shall be on the way up when you get this. We go by train to start with and then move a little way and sleep and on the next day. We don't go into the front line at once, but should be there say within 10 days from now. We have spent some time this afternoon trying to get a gramophone to work but owing to the owner having gone on leave and taken the precaution to take the winding key with him, he has baffled us for the present. I had a letter from Colins to-day written on Xmas day after he had just come out of the trenches. He tells me that Murf is at Palermo in the A. S. C. Lucky beggar with the prospect of a pleasant spring time on the Riviera with the Sicilian equivalent. Love to all Jack. ",1916-01-02,Mother
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for yours of the 30th also for Cecily's. The Autocar and the Hassall Bertin Tapestry. Aquascutum sent the strap all right. thank you for getting it out of them. I have been in St. Omer all day to-day buying a hand cart for the Battn. to use up in the trenches. It was pretty hard to get and the lady did her best to rob me. but with the help of the Brigade Interpreter we got her to reduce the price. Incidentally I got a very decent lunch and a bath the latter very welcome, as the inhabitants of this place do not bathe. I didn't want to ride in, as it is a long way on a very uninteresting road, so I cadged rides off passing vehicles and got in for some of the way in a Divisional car and the rest in the post office van. Coming out I struck another Divisional Car for practically all the way and then a friendly French officer brought me right in. I missed a lecture on our new trenches, but it won't matter, as we are going into reserve at first so I shall probably wade round them some night before we go in. An officer of the Battalion whom we are relieving has come down to take over these billets, with the interpreter who used to be with us (the one that wept by the roadside) and is now with them. he seems very much as he was except that he has got horribly fat. When we go up I shall probably see something of Wipers. I will describe it if I can. It will be very interesting to see. and we may live there for a bit. Of course underground. The Divisional fellow who lectured to-day said that the drainage of the trenches up there had puzzled them for sometime, till someone discovered an old map of the place in the British Museum, which told them all they wanted to know. I am on a Court Martial to-morrow and may not have time to write for a few days. Love to all and Joe if he's with you. Jack. ",1916-01-03,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your and Cecily's letters of the 2nd which I have just received, also for Richard Carvell, which I am reading and like very much, and Quinneys from Cecily which I have not had time to start yet. We moved from our last billet on Tuesday leaving the house at 4.45 a.m. which, you will appreciate, suited me down to the ground, as I always was an early riser. We had a 3 hour journey by train, which sounds long but which was really only about 30 miles, and then we marched to our rest camp in this area which we shall use when we come out of the trenches. It is only about a mile from our old one, where we were before we went back. The new one is an appalling place as regards mud, and we had a bad time the first night, as we never got into touch with our transport till about 10 at night, and consequently got nothing to eat. yesterday we moved up into Dugouts within a mile or two of the line, and we stay here for a few days till it is our turn to go right in, and then we have a few days there and then we go back to the rest-camp for more and then repeat. The dugouts we are in now are very good, quite new and dry. The objection is that we are surrounded by Batteries which loose off fairly continuously and they are all big guns, so they make the Deuce of a noise. We are in grounds of a Chateau which is reputed to belong to a Hun whom the Belgians got rid of early in the war as a spy. Anyhow true or not, so far the Hun has spared the Chateau, and I trust he will continue to do so. I am in quite a comfortable hut with a bedstead, but no mattress, but it is inclined to be chilly, as if it is made of canvass. However it promises well as we have had a terrific galewith rain, and nothing seems to have come through. Our difficulty is to get anything cooked, as we have no stove, and as I am doing the housekeeping I have to care for these things. I hear today that the Hun has proposed peace through the Rothschilds, and the story gives the exact terms so I don't believe a word of it. Everyone seems to think that they're getting fed up, and all down the line we seem to be going out in parties dropping bombs on them, but they very rarely come over and drop bombs on us. Some people think that they are going back from this bit of the line, so as to make theirs shorter, but I devoutly hope they don't, as we shall have nowhere to live if we follow them. I think Reggie Daw is up near here somewhere. I heard that some of his Division were in the train for Egypt after having got rid of all their kit, and then they were hauled out again. Rather hard luck when they were all experiencing a pleasant winter season in Cairo. Love to all from Jack. ",1916-01-07,Mother
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for your letter of the 6th, also for a L. O. Bystander and sketch. I had an enormous mail yesterday which is always gratifying. The last two days have been quite interesting. Yesterday I went up with the C. O. to look over the positions we have to take up if an attack is made (as you know we are at present in local reserve). This meant a stroll round Wipers, which I had not seen so close before. It must have been a lovely old place before the arrival of the Bosch. It has a sheer wall on its Eastern and S. sides with other ramparts in front and though the walls have been badly straffed they look as good as ever. I've never seen such a place for shell holes and craters. All the houses seem to be knocked about, tho many are standing on the outskirts. I believe the centre of the town is all in ruins. but I shall see that another day. The whole country here is full of batteries of various sorts and sizes. You see a nice looking bush and out of the other side a gun nozzle w spout is to be observed. Similarly out of old houses and even out of the ground and the beastly things loose off just as you are going in front. We found our positions all right tho they appear to be more or less under water, but I hope we shan't have to occupy them. To-day we went further up to the Battn. Hqrs. whose trenches we are taking over. quite a pleasant walk on a very jolly day. One blessing is that you can hardly get up to our front line trenches in the day time so I shall probably only do one journey p. d instead of two. Everything is done on a grand scale. If they catch sight of you, they snipe you with Whizz bangs instead of a mere bullet and you are quite indignant if they shell your dug outs with anything less than a 9 inch crump. I was very amused when the adjt. retur (of the other battn) arrived back breathless having been chased back along his trench with whizz bangs. It was the idiot's own fault as he had a shiny black Mackintosh on which shone in the sun like a greenhouse and of course the Hun was tempted. On the way back we watched them put 100- odd shells into Wipers. One of the big ones got the top of one of the remaining churches and fairly did for it. One thing about these trenches is that neither side fires much with their rifles. I suppose such things are too small for them and when in the trenches they are fairly all right except for the mud. In our other places it has been al rifle fire and only moderate shelling. The men have great difficulty in cooking up there, so I am off to Poperinghe to-morrow to see if I can get any oil stoves, as they seem to solve the problem. Cooking with coal or wood means smoke and that means a shell at once. We are well in the aeroplane area of both sides so we get all the bits of the shells exploded near them dropping back on us. I am thinking of adopting an umbrella. I have just had letters from two most unexpected people. Alice Orton and Ina Cave. Love to all Jack P. S. I've paid the license for the pram. so you can ease your mind about driving it. ",1916-01-09,Cecily
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your long letter of the 4th enclosing the Application From which I have signed and return. I was very interested to hear about the consumption test on the pram. I take it that it will work out about 32 m. p. g. which I suppose is fair tho' I think she ought to do better. Those Zenith Carburettors are very sound but you can't play tricks with them to adjust them and I daresay she would do more with a different make. I shall require a commission from Wardill if everyone gets one. they will all probably try for something with 4 Cylinders, which are all right for a man, but rather difficult for a girl to start. I have met several on the road quite helpless because they couldn't turn the handle. I have heard from the S. Antonio people on the subject of earthquakes and labour and am still in two minds about taking up more shares. They have got S. F. Edger on the board, which may be a good thing as he may be able to get the capital, but from what I have read and heard of him, he is an obstinate blighter and will probably cause trouble in the end. However we are not very deeply involved anyway. With regard to North, the only people I have heard of their taking for ammunition work are those skilled in certain trades the names of which I have never heard before. We sent some to be tested last month but none were taken from this battalion, tho' the W. Kents had some taken. I should recommend that she applies to the Munitions board, stating exactly what the boy's trade is (engineering is too broad) and if she gets a letter from his former employer certifying his efficiency, I should not be surprised if they send for him, provided that his is a trade in which they are short of men and that there are no testers near his Battn. If he can be tested out here no doubt he will be. I have written another letter to-day home. Yrs. Jack. ",1916-01-09,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter to-day. Also for an Autocar and for a letter from Odd. I have spent the day in buying oil stoves for the men to use in the trenches. I first had to find the Cashier and of course found that when I had got to his office, he was out for the day with the at a place a mile back on the road I had come and then my gee shed a shoe and then I had a 5. mile ride into Poperinghe to get the stoves and I hadn't the vaguest idea what the French for stove is. Luckily I met an interpreter who told me and then I went into every shop in the town to buy them, but there were none till at last I found some. Obviously made in Germany though labelled very big made in Sweden. Still they are worth having whether made by the Hun or no. and then I hadn't got enough money to pay for them so the trusting lady let me go away owing her 5 fr. or more which I suppose I shall have to pay, tho Heaven knows she has made a 300% profit already. I daresay you have seen that they have sent some men from the fleet to look round. I believe that the sailormen were getting rather bored at the way our people get leave and go back to rest while they are always at sea. so they sent some out to see what it was like. They put some of them first of all for 48 hours in the trenches by Boesinghe at the W. corner of the salient which is a waiting spot, and when they had finished there, they offered to show them the upper end of the salient and Wipers. and they asked at once must they go. So they said they must and they went and after a little of Hooge they are completely cured. This is probably all a yarn, as I see some of them were at Hulluch in the S. but I can quite imagine that a dose of Hooge would cure anyone of anything. My candle is going out and I've not got another, so I must stop. Love from Jack. ",1916-01-10,Mother
"How much of what I am going to write is true I cannot vouch for, but I will tell you as nearly as I can what the version of the blowing up of the Natal is, down here. It is supposed that 9 (some say 12) ladies and a few children were on board at lunch and early in the afternoon a Pinnace left the Ship to go and bring 40 children on board for a Children's Party, and soon after the Pinnace had gone towards the shore, there was a large black cloud and the Natal disappeared. The water-tight doors are said to have jammed so everyone below was shut in. A few Bluejackets escaped some very much injured. I knew of an Officer's servant who had his hand blown off, and another man was badly scalded. The Captain's and commander's Wives were both and board, and their deaths have been in the Papers as ""suddenly on the 30th,"" but no place mentioned. Back and Hutchings were the names. It is said to have occurred in the Harbor off Invergordon, but opinions differ as to whether it was off Cromartie. My Geography is shaky about Scotland but someone said the places are on either side of the Bay. Supposed to have been done by a Clockwork Bomb same as the Bulwark and Irene. The Officers saved were said to be on leave at the time. I knew Fleet Surgeon Tuck very well, and when I've time will write, but he won't say much that one has not heard before. The Backs' two children were waiting with the Nurse to go off to the ship. They were well known here, he being the Flag Captain for some time. I am told the Factor of Invergordon his wife and 4 children all were on board. It is really the most ghastly thing. Of course Captain Back was a marked man, as he'd been the means of having several German Submarines caught. I knew Staff Surgeon Hooper well by sight, having often seen him playing Cricket. It is said the Wife and children of the Officer in charge of the Pinnace were on board. ",1916-01-11,Unknown
"My dear Cecily, Very many thanks for your letter to-day, also for a Q. book which I got yesterday. I am very glad to hear the pram is going strong, and that she is not eating her head off. I write this from my little dug out in a wood, in what is left of it, about 300 yards behind the line. The dug out is not unlike a rabbit hole below the level of the ground and inclined to be moist, and I have to have it bailed out but the water doesn't interfere as I've got a floor with a hole for the water beneath. I also have a bed table and chair, so I am not really badly off. The weather is a bit chilly with a strong wind, but I found last night that I kept quite warm after blocking up the door. The trenches here are a maze, as they run through a wood and have belonged to the Huns and ourselves at different times. It is very difficult to see where one's own trenches end and the Huns begin but he is very quiet here and though he shells from time to time and also drops in some enormous minnenwerfer bombs which break up the trees and make them fall into our trenches, he is really comparatively peaceful. I fancy that he gets such a deuce of a time from our guns round about that he doesn't make himself too obnoxious. The Divisional G. O. C. announced his intention of coming up to-day to look round, but he never got nearer than Brigade Headquarters which after all is only wise as we don't want him. I thought it would be a good thing to put a man in the wood and tell them to fire somewhere near by and then swear that there was a sniper out for him, but such a strong course did not prove necessary. The rations cause rather a bother as our battalion is very much split up with various machine guns. and bombing posts in the most unlikely places. We have a wooden tram line to bring things up on, but as we had before but it doesn't come far enough and it is a very long and muddy walk to bring them on. On getting here yesterday we went right through Ypres and saw the parts which have been most badly damaged. Parts of the Cloth Hall is still standing but the houses all round and what I imagine was the Cathedral are simply pounded to atoms. The outskirts are not so badly hurt, though I don't suppose there is a single home in the place which is untouched. It was very curious walking through the streets, where the houses are still standing and not a sound or movement in them, as of course they are all empty. Still more curious as we were going through the center of the town where most of the strafing has been and were surveying the scene of desolation with feelings properly attuned, a strong and lusty chorus of some topical song burst out of the bowels of the earth at our feet, proceeding from one of our Battalions who I suppose are quartered there and were trying to cheer themselves up in such a godforsaken spot -- I had to spend 2 hours at X roads known as Hell fire corner while the Battn was going by in parties, and was very nervous lest the wily Bosch should shell it but he was quite silent. As a matter of fact these places get their names very easily I know 2 shrapnel corners and one Hell blast corner and I've never seen a shell at any of them. Anyhow this particular spot was like Piccadilly Circus with endless streams of men going and coming fatigue parties, dozens of limbers which make enough noise to stir even a Bosch into activity and a motor lorry. but nothing happened and when I left there was a Bank holiday crowd still there. We are being relieved at once and then do a tour at the back and then up again. I don't know why they are giving us such a short time here this spell, but we don't mind. Of course we were all detailed to take over one section of the trenches and had made all arrangements to do so and at the last minute were sent off to take over another, but that is like them. The C. O. is going on leave this week if he can. So I shall have the Battn. on my hands for a few days. Love to all Jack ",1916-01-13,Cecily
"My dear Father, Many thanks for yours of the 13th and for the cigars, which look to be in good condition and if they smoke as well as the last will be A1. have you taken out the Driving License 10/- or the owners license (which in this case is £3.3.0) I didn't take out the owners license last year as you did it for me, but I have paid for it this year though it has not arrived yet I have just heard from Katie Paull. she has got a small Peugeot like the thing the Hollingsworths in Strawberry Lane have. They go like anything but I think the pram is probably more suitable for our requirements. I have heard from Cousin Alice that the girls and Decie looked so pretty at the wedding and commenting on the fact that none of the elders were there and she puts it down to the discomfort of travelling in winter so any pleas of yours or anyone else's of overwork have not washed. I am very sorry for you that Cox is going but I hope Miss Jarred will carry on all right. Yours Jack ",1916-01-16,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last and for an Autocar. Also thanks to Cecily for her letter received to-day and for a Primus stove arrived to-day. The gloves have arrived and I like them very much. The stove should be very useful. We are still in our rest camp, where we fondly imagined we were at peace with everyone except aeroplanes, only they have now started shelling the neighborhood. They don't appear to be doing any harm but of course the whole district is full of huts and troops and they may get on to one in time. They are miles from us anyhow. I expect it is the same gun which shells Poperinghe which is only a little way off. I have had a present of some Tiptree jam to-day from Aunt Katie Paul. Cecily mentions eatables in her letter and I should like a cake very much as we haven't had one for some time. Our time now is chiefly occupied in repairing a small fort, which is now in the Battalion's charge. There are lots of them stuck about the country in case the Hun breaks through and we have to keep one in repair. It was handed over in a pretty bad state and wants a lot of work on it. They caught a spy near here the other day. He was in a cottage near one of our big guns and one morning they noticed that the Hun was feeling his way up to the gun and when he got there plumped several shells right round it. He was the owner of the cottage and everyone noticed that his family rushed out in white garments, evidently to attract the attention of an aeroplane overhead, so they took him off in handcuffs. Anyhow they smashed up our gun I believe. A better spy story is of a baker somewhere near here, and everyone knows he is a spy as they never get shelled unless there is smoke going up from his chimney. But they don't touch him as he is so valuable because they all go to ground directly his chimneys smoke. and no damage is done. They even take the baker with them to make sure he is not hurt as of course he is invaluable as a warning for shell fire. We are taking over another section of trenches next door to the ones we had last time, so I shall have to go up and have a look round before we go in. Then when we come out we shall go back into our last lot and so on. I wonder if you gave Uncle John a run in the pram. He was much impressed by Aunt K.'s and she says he will get one himself and I shouldn't be surprised. Love to all Jack. ",1916-01-20,Mother
"My dear Mother Many thanks for your last letter also for a Pett Ridge Book from Cecily and The Climber from yourself. We are still back in camp and will be going up again early next week. I have been up to-day to have a look around but did not go into the first trenches but only to Battalion Headquarters which in this case are a long way behind, so far that they keep a forward Battn. Headquarters a good deal further up, which I gather is an inconvenient sort of place but which I shall inhabit with the signalling officer and some of the satellites. The Primus Stove has come and should prove very useful and I am very much obliged for it. The Battalion Headquarters are very good deep down in a big bank of earth and except that they have no light they would be ideal. They have electric light laid on but the machine only works about 4 hours per diem. So the rest of the time they have to rely on candles. However this is a small consideration and the dug outs are well furnished with things which have found their way there out of Wipers. I went through the town again to-day and as I have lately seen some postcards of what it used to be, it was rather interesting comparing its present and past. I saw an aeroplane battle yesterday and one came down but I could not see where it was. It fell behind our lines and a French one came down shortly afterwards and hovered over the place, so I trust it was a Bosche. They seem to be doing rather well with their new aeroplanes just now though to-night's papers say we got 6 on Tuesday. The one I saw ought to be mentioned in to-days communiqué which of course I've not seen yet. I'm told that there was a good description of our trenches in last Tuesday's Daily mail but I didn't see it, so cannot say for myself. Our new doctor has arrived -- rather a little worm, I fear. Love to all. Jack. ",1916-01-21,Mother
"My dear Mother Very many thanks for your letter of the 20th. I suppose the new plot is at New Anzac on Sea which I have seen advertised. Congratul- ations on winning it though they will probably start dunning you to build a house on it and then come down on you for drains and making up the roads. However you may be able to sell it or they might swop it for a plot of the same size in Bond St. which would really be worth something. I am very glad to hear Miss Waldie is calling, as I don't think she has any friends in the country and I thought from her letters that she was rather stranded. I have been able to tell her nothing about her brother and can get no information anywhere. He was a very good chap and I should very much like to hear that he is all right, but I'm afraid the chances are against him now. We have got another new subaltern arrived to-day, which makes our normal strength well over what it should be, but there are so many of them away on odd jobs in the Brigade and Division that we are sometimes hard put to it to find them and a few more are consequently not unwelcome. They have to-day started selling whiskey in the Poperinghe Canteen which is a blessing to a mess president as we have always had to get it from Havre before, and it never arrived when wanted So we have had to fall back on the local water which has a distinct taste of its own and has to be disguised in tea or cocoa or cafe au lait. Please thank Cecily for a London Opinion and Passing show arrived to-day. It looks from to-days papers as though the aeroplane I saw come down two days ago was one of ours as I see the Huns claim one as coming down behind our lines on the Yser. I notice that the Belgians do not call Wipers Ypres but Yper. Anyhow that is the name on the Station Platform board. Perhaps Ypres is French and Yper Flemish. I have seen direction posts pointing to Yper-Ypers and as they do most of their notices in both languages this may be the explanation. Both sides nowadays seem to spend their ingenuity in playing tricks on the other. Up here somewhere the other day we loosed off a lot of smoke to make the Huns think it was gas, which they did and accordingly manned all their trenches and then we turned all the guns we'd got on to them. and then they started strafing one of our trenches and when they had gone on for a long time they sent out a patrol to have a look to see whether we had taken our men away and the patrol found that we hadn't and got sappered. The G. O. C. I'm told was very sick that they didn't collar them, as they want to find out who is opposite us, but it is none too easy as the ground between the trenches is a mass of shell craters and mud and you can hardly get along outside the front of the trenches. I shall be busy to-morrow so may not write and will send my next from my little rabbit hutch. Yrs. Jack ",1916-01-23,Mother
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for yours dated Monday Jan. 13th. So far as I know Monday was not the 13th. so I don't know whether it has taken a week or more to get here. but it is about your and Fathers drive to Epsom in the go-cart. Many thanks for a book from you and a London Opinion and Passing Show which I got 2 days ago. We came up yesterday and I thought I should be back in the ramparts of Wipers, but the C. O. turned up last night, so I have come up to our forward headquarters, which consist of 3 or 4 fairly respectable but undoubtedly moist dug outs, where I dwell in state with the Signalling officer, a Gunner Observation Officer and their menials. We are rather off the track and everyone is strictly forbidden to move about near by or to come in to the place by day or the wily Hun will inevitably spot us and then we shall be crumped out of it. They landed a whizz bang bang on top of one of the dugouts yesterday, but did no harm and I am in the dug out at the moment. I am within a few yards of the Menin Road, which Ted Bourchier used to talk such a lot about, but which cannot be really so bad, as the trees each side are still standing. I don't fancy using it more than necessary as they play machine guns on it at odd intervals. Hell fire corner which I have already told you is about 300 yards off. Our trenches are shewn on the map as being in --- Wood, and I went round last night expecting a moonlight stroll through the sylvan glades, with the nightingales warbling around, but in reality the place is as open as the palm of your hand, the wood having ceased to exist. The place is in a most awful state, as it has been fought over endless times and is full of crump holes and old trenches and German wire and a few mine craters and is really nothing less than a rubbish heap with a few trenches which we occupy built up among the rubbish. They had a tremendous strafing a few days ago and some of the trenches were knocked to bits and we have got to build them up again. We had a Zeppelin or some sort of Airship over our camp 2 nights ago. I heard the thing but did not realise what it was, so did not go out to look. But it was very high up and could hardly be seen. It dropped some bombs at Poperinghe and another one came over Wipers last night and dropped a bomb or two there. I think we have been doing a little bomb dropping somewhere and this is their retaliation. Excuse this paper, but it is raining and the dug out roof is hardly waterproof. Love to all Jack ",1916-01-24,Cecily
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for another letter from you which arrived last night. I am still here in my little dug-out, a trifle moist but otherwise quite comfortable. It is just 3 pm and I am about to have lunch -- our hours in the trenches are always very topsy turvy. One goes round our trenches at night and sleeps by day. I went to bed this morning at 5 am and got up for breakfast at 11:30 am. In our particular case one can only go round at night as half of our trenches you can only reach them as the communic- ation trench has gone and you have to go overland. But I daresay in time the trench will be reclaimed. There is a fair amount of artillery strafing and aeroplane shooting going on now, but otherwise in the day time things are pretty quiet. I have just been having my dug out bailed out. It is quite a long job to keep the water down below the flow boards. the Primus stove is a great boon here as we can get our meals at any time and I had a very good early meal at 4 am this morning. The C. O. and myself in our solitary state cooking cocoa and milk to help down tongue and bread must have been very edifying. I had the G. O. C. to call yesterday morning. I let him see I didn't want him, as we don't allow more people than possible to come over here in the day time, as they have to come across the open and the Bosch can see them. and he was quite humble. He was very anxious to know whether I had reported a little shelling that was going on a little way on the flank and pointed out that I ought to do so as that Battalions wires might have been cut, but the good man hardly realises that there is shelling going on around here all day and that one would have to be glued to the telephone to report it all. However the good man went up to the Battalion on our right and came in for no end of a strafing. So he went home sadder and wiser. The Battalion aforesaid got a little of their own back in a bombing stunt which was going on at about 3.30 am this morning and which was very effective from a spectacular point of view. The Hun opposition trench planted a flag in between the lines the night before we came in. The regiment we relieved tried to get it but could not. One of our fellows however got it in last night. It is a little Bosch flag with the Double Eagle in the centre and an inscription has been printed on it evidently by the Bosch who planted it. I have not got a copy of the inscription. but it alludes to Dicke Bertha, which is their polite way of referring to their 17 in gun. Dicke meaning bulging and Bertha Miss Krupp -- a delicate allusion to her proportions It also alludes to the 27th inst, which I believe is the Kaiser's birthday, so I suppose we shall do all we can to strafe them then. We have been experimenting with pigeons to-day and get our messages back to a town behind and so up to our Brigade very quickly. Love to all Jack ",1916-01-25,Cecily
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letter written on Sunday last and received last night. Also still more thanks for the promise of the binoculars. I think it would be a mistake to have them at the moment, as I very rarely need them now and I have the pair which Mother gave me which are quite powerful, though I think the Ross glasses are probably bigger. I have sent a cheque to the Antonio Company and told them to send the Certificate for 100 new shares to you. Would you mind keeping it, as also the enclosed receipt for my insurance premium. I think Wardills charge for 4 months is quite moderate as the pram has not been idle. A good deal of that charge is mine, viz garage and juice for the period I was at home and I send my cheque herewith. A very quiet day here with a little artillery strafing. I heard a most curious noise this morning and thought it was a new engine invented by the Hun but eventually discovered it came from a flock of geese travelling N. E. overhead. They fly in a wedge shaped formation and seem well disciplined. I was round the trenches this afternoon and ran across the G. O. C. with a bevy of minor lights in the shape of mining and sapper officers and smaller fry galore, so I joined in the train and the procession moved on. I am going round again late to-night with the O. C. of the Battalion who relieves us to-morrow. when we go back for a few days then back here again. These constant reliefs are an awful nuisance, but we find that the men cannot stand too much, as they have little or no shelter and many of them very little sleep. Those actually in the front line are better off than those in the support lines, as the latter have to find all the fatigues and it is no joke lugging up rations over broken ground and muddy trenches in the dark. We have to bring all our water up and engineer stoves, so you can imagine that there is a lot to carry. I was very glad Miss Waldie called, as I rather imagine that she has few friends in this country and I thought that you might be able to help her. Her family are in the lumber business I think and I imagine are blessed with more than their share of this worlds goods. To-morrow is said to be the Kaiser's birthday and we shall be on the look out for squalls, but he is said to have a birthday almost once a month, so I don't really suppose there is anything in it. We had a tremendous spy scare last night and everyone was warned to look out for him. He was supposed to be dressed like a British officer and we eventually captured him, when he turned out to be an officer belonging to the next Battalion who had lost his way. Love to all From Jack ",1916-01-26,Father
"My dear Mother (and family) I have to acknowledge to-day an enormous mail item one colossal cake which I prepare to sample shortly, item one box of cigars very good and welcome as I smoked the last one of the last box last night item a letter from you item another from Cecily item another from Odd and with it one from Odd dated the 19th November written from the hospital. I am sorry the pram has given in. I rather suspect that Wardill has not seen that the bearings of the Differential and back axle and also the bearing on the sliding joint in the connecting rod from the engine ^ gear box to the back axle have not been greased. These should be done frequently and are easily overlooked I hope the pram won't be out of action long and that the damage is not serious. While I am on the subject. Wardill ought to see that the wheel bearings are greased, as I never did it, as I couldn't see how to, and she will run hot and melt the bearings if left alone. When she returns, Wardill ought to go over her carefully and grease and oil every hole he finds. I don't know why the lamps should fail except for lack of oil and if Wardill lets you go out without oil you will get fined and he ought to be strafed. I see the Daily Express (Tuesday's issue) has a good deal to say about New Anzac on Sea and implies that it is a swindle. It asks for the names of all people who have got a plot of land there and it might be worth while to send yours up, so that if there is anything wrong you would know about it. Apparently you are to be charged £3.3.0 for Solicitors fees for the Conveyance and one man offered his plot for 3d and couldn't find a buyer. We are now back in camp, having been relieved last night. and go back again to the same trenches in a few days. I am not sorry to get out, but there is nothing to do back here, as everything and place is a sea of mud and we can only go on repairing our fort, which is a dull proceeding. I was up all the night before last as we thought there might be something on for the Kaisers birthday, but it was quite quiet. We had a little bomb show on our own and blew them out of their position in a mine crater which they hold. but these things are of no real value as don't do really much damage with a bomb. We found a position to swipe down the length of one of their trenches, which is an ideal spot and our man loosed off about 50 rounds every time with a target in the shape of a fat Hun, so we must have annoyed them considerable. We have been having some fun with the Division lately as they have been showing themselves rather incompetent lately so the C. O. has just brought them to their knees on one point and I had the A. P. M. on toast while the C. O. was away and our Transport Officer drove the G. O. C. into a ditch last night (unbeknown of course) so I should say that we must be rather popular at the moment. But at times these brass hats are rather trying. The G. O. C. was wandering round our trenches last night, so they took him out over some awful country to look on an isolated post we had got and rather humbled him. I am rather glad he is coming round, as he sees exactly the conditions under which things have to be done. This fairly frightened the staff colonel who was with the G. O. C. The old man was awfully worried when they drove him into the ditch and sent out one of the Brigade staff to control the traffic. as if it was possible to control any traffic with a lot of very unhandy mules in the limbers. A pitch dark night and a road cut to bits with shells and to cram all 2 or 3 feet of mud on either side. I have sent a blue carbon copy of this letter to Odd. Love to all Jack. ",1916-01-29,Family
"My dear Cecily, Very many thanks for a L. O. and Love in a Cottage which I got last night. I am writing this in a cellar in Wipers, where we are for the moment and I am going up to the trenches to-night and back again in ^ a few days time to the same cellar. The whole Battalion I need hardly say is not in the same cellar. but it is in different places about the town and some of it is still back in camp. This particular cellar is dry, but rather chilly and the Primus was very useful last night in warming it up and I am getting it to go again now. I must also thank someone for the London Magazine, which also arrived yesterday. This place is very quiet now though of course they have not given up shelling it altogether. They put a few shells in daily, so I daresay they will be starting soon. I don't know that I have much to tell you. We were not sorry to leave camp yesterday as it is a muddy spot and it was practically impossible to find anything for the men to do, as there is nowhere to do it. However most of them are taken up to the front line at night on working parties. So they want to sleep by day. The weather has changed considerably the last few days and there is now an East Wind which is rather cold. However there is no frost and I think we can consider ourselves jolly lucky in the weather we have had as I don't think we have had frost since November. I am sorry to be talking of the weather, but there is nothing else to talk of except that they have apparently begun their morning hate, as I can hear distant thuds, also the general has just come in and complains that we are very stuffy in here, which must be the effect of the stove though I don't notice the stuffiness myself and would be glad if it was a little stuffy. As it is the cellar is full of ventilators and is in fact rather draughty. Love to all Jack. I have not sent a copy of this letter to Odd as it is such tosh. ",1916-01-31,Cecily
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter yester received to-day and for the literature about New Anzac on Sea. I hope the place is all they say it is and that it will go well -- if so your plot should be worth something. Please thank Cecily for her letter undated which I got yesterday and for Punch to-day. I am now back in camp and I suppose that we shall not be going up again for some little time. I came back last night and had rather a poor time, as my gee was rather fresh and got startled in the dark by a motor lorry so he reared and hit me over the eye with the back of his head and then slipped and came down I got clear but he was up and away at once quite in the wrong direction. I didn't mind about him so much, but as he had all my kit and Aquascutum, I had to follow on my flat feet. I walked up the road after him for about a mile, but as I was then nearly on the Yser Canal, I came back in a motor lorry. Luckily I had got back about 2 miles and I met my groom with the horse who was looking for me. The gee apparently turned back along a railway and went home and as I heard a train going back, I fancy it must have chased him and given him the fright of his life. Anyway he was covered with mud and had been very hot, so I hope he has learnt a little wisdom. I have not gathered quite what happened to the pram, but I suppose none of you know. I should very much like to know when you find out and what the reason was. After all it may be that it is not strong enough to take 3 people in as I have from time to time. I was rather caught yesterday, as my servant suddenly turned a purple colour and has gone to hospital. I don't quite know why unless he has had too much of Cecily's unbeknownst to me. Anyhow he has gone and forgotten to divulge where he has taken my weeks washing, so there is a clean vest and pair of unmentionables not to speak of numerous socks and hand kerchiefs lying in some cottage round here andI don't know where they are. However I hope that one of the other servants now at Wipers will be able to trace them. I am very glad the Appam has been found, as it shows that they are not sinking them. I take it that G. will wire the ship she comes in and when she leaves. Curiously enough I saw a Zepp. on Monday night. I was going round the trenches and saw a curious light in the sky, which I took to be a comet. I watched it for sometime, but it was very misty and when it disappeared I thought the clouds had hidden it. Love to all from Jack. ",1916-02-05,Mother
"My dear Father Very many thanks for your letters of the 5th and 6th and for Cecily's of the 5th. I expect the Lingfield man will find it a bit difficult to get the parts he requires, as I suppose the company is making munitions. I was anxious about the greasing of it, as it is so easy to overlook, but of course if Wardill has done it all right the trouble must have begun some long time ago -- before I had it, as I used to fill it up the grease constantly and probably overdid it if anything. I shouldn't be surprised if Glad turned up in the and the will hardly continue to operate in the same district, as it will be distinctly unhealthy. Many thanks for getting a new number for the pram. I have been on a Court Martial all this morning and have duly sentenced 4 very mild criminals, so I suppose the thumb-screws are now being got ready. Master J. Bourchier has I fancy not allowed his story to lose in the telling. If he is constantly in and near Ypres, he may have been in trouble as they are strafing the roads like anything at the present time. but I thought he was carrying ammunition for a heavy battery and I hardly see how they can be as far up. However I may be wrong. When I said the new binoculars are probably bigger than the others, I meant in magnifying power. In actual size they are a trifle longer, but not quite so broad as my present ones. The aeroplanes are very active to-day, and at the moment they are strafing a up above us and the bits of aeroplane shells are falling back round here. One bit has gone right through a hut and given the occupier thereof a nasty smack on the shoulder whereat he seems rather startled. Since writing the last sentence I hear it is the whole of an unexploded shell which has knocked his shoulder about pretty badly and continued through the floor of the hut 6 feet into the ground. It is freezing again to-night and is rather cold, so I am warming my hut with a wood fire, coal being at the moment unprocurable, though I am shortly expecting one of our mess waiters back with some as he confessed to-day to knowing of a place where it can be obtained, but he artlessly added that he has to wait till it is dark to get it -- so I changed the subject. If this weather continues I must go round and see the N. C. O. who issues the coal with a small gift in my hand. Would you mind ordering a mediumly soft (not floppy and yet not too stiff) service cap for me size 6 7/8 without sunshield. to be sent out at once. I burnt mine accidentally in a candle last night and find the ordinance here have got none. I will send a cheque when I hear what they want. Yrs. Jack. ",1916-02-09,Father
"Dear Father, Since sending up my other letter, I find I have left out the motorman letter and card which I return. I fancy the cost will be covered by my insurance. but there is some question of bearing the first £5 in it I think. Anyhow that question can be gone into later -- especially as it looks as tho' you aren't going to be allowed any petrol to drive it. You will have to use Parrafin and fake up some way of using a little petrol in the carburettor to start her. Love Jack ",1916-02-09,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter to-day and for Punch and John Bull. You all seem quite determined that I am to get leave soon, but there is no immediate prospect. We are gradually working through the list of officers, but there are 5 or 6 more with the Battalion to go before my turn comes and then there is the question of officers on detached duty. I don't fancy myself that my turn will come before march and I shall wait for Glad if there is any immediate prospect of her returning soon. I am very glad to hear about the pram and hope it is running all right to-day and that Father has had a good run from Oxted. It is now very cold with a North-wind and it has froze the last 2 nights, so it looks as if winter has come. At the moment we are very suspicious of a windmill close by which appears to stop and start at unusual intervals and for no apparent reason. The men say that it stops when troops are going along the road, but that doesn't appear to be the case. However I think they ought to insist that the thing goes all day or stops all day. Love to all Jack copy to Olive sent to-day ",1916-02-10,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for yours of the 10th and for the Caravaners from Cecily. I am none the worse for my fall from the gee, only I am glad to say it was not into soft mud though regret still that it was on to very hard cobbles. I don't fancy there is anything in the naval battle rumor, or we should have heard something here. We had a bit of excitement here last night as the artillery were going for all they were worth up the road and we didn't know what was up, so we were prepared to set out for Berlin at any minute. but nothing happened. I think our guns have been rather too busy lately, so the Hun got irritated and let 'em have it back yester- day in earnest and of course we had to reply. so that is what all the noise was. I don't expect the infantry has had any say in it at all and certainly not in our section -- which seemed so quiet that we thought they had declared peace. I have at last recovered my washing, for which I have been searching the countryside for a week and then only by sending miles away to a hospital to find out from my servant there what he had done with it. I went out yesterday with the C. O. to look at our fort and on the way we picked up the Brigadier and as we were going across country, we made the little man jump a ditch, which was rather too much for him and he very nearly went right in. However we got to the place and found there the Divisional G. O. C. and the C. R. E. (sapper C. O.) and another brass hat and all because we had asked to be supplied with some barbed wire to put round the place. so it shows how little these brass hat shave to do that they should interest themselves in such details. Any competent sergeant could have calculated the amount of wire in 5 minutes, but it took these people one hour to arrive at the amount and I don't suppose they are right now. They say that there was a Zeppelin over here during the excitement yesterday afternoon. I saw some coloured streamers in the air, which I thought had been dropped from an aeroplane but which they now say were dropped from a Zepp. There was a flock of aeroplanes up there too, so I suppose they were chasing the Zepp. Love to all Jack. I have sent Odd a copy of this. ",1916-02-13,Mother
"My dear Family, Many thanks for a letter from Odd and an Autocar and John Bull. I took it that Odd will return soon after this letter arrives, so I am not sending a copy. No particular news. The Hun got bumptious yesterday and sent over a couple of aeroplanes who dropped some bombs near a neighboring camp, but no damage. It was rather interesting as the Huns appeared a tremendous height up while lots of ours were flying about below, but of course they couldn't touch him and when they climbed up level the Hun was off though the second one caught it a bit, as we could hear them strafing each other and the Hun descended fairly rapidly to a lower level. The bombs make an extraordinary noise coming down, quite different to a shell but they are ridiculous little things really as they can't take big ones in scouting aeroplanes. The guns were hard at it again to-night and we thought we should have to go up to put things straight and got on the road ready to do so, only they didn't want us at a matter of fact they lose their heads and just because we stir the Hun with activity as we have been doing lately and he replies they imagine he is going to attack when really if he shows a nose above his parapet he gets it strafed off, and an attack is the very last thing he wants to bring off. He did get into a trench up here the other day when I told you there was some excitement on but he didn't stay more than 10 minutes -- as they blew him out with bombs. I went round our R. E. Dump to-day (i. e. their distributing centre) with the C. O. to see the various gadgets they make. They are a sort of Turnery Dept. of the Army and Navy Stores and keep all sorts of odds and ends which are most useful. I shall probably not have time to write to-morow. Love Jack.

"My dear family, Here I am again in the burrow and a pretty damp one at that, as we have had a lot of rain the last two days. This particular spot has undergone a lot of alteration at the hands of the Bosch since I was here a month ago. Apparently they spent last Sunday in attending to it and certainly they have succeeded in stirring it up, but no great damage done. The Hun has made 3 attempts on various trenches round the salient this last week and got in to our trenches thrice. Once he was turned out immediately and the other time he wasn't ejected till the next night, and these were partly the identical trenches we first held when we came in last October. They have been tremendously active all round for the last week, but it looks to me as though they were trying to see if they could get in anywhere and now they find they can't it may be they will shut up. Anyhow to-day you wouldn't know there was a war going on it is so quiet. We have had tremendous gales the last few days, to-day without rain, so perhaps things will dry up a bit Love to all Jack.

"My dear Father, Many thanks for Sunday's letter which arrived last night, also for one from Cecily and Mother, also for a Bystander. I expect someone has sent me a cap by now, but in the event of my letter having missed you will someone please send me a service cap without a sunshield and moderately stiff. but not floppy. I have a cap badge. My own cap I burnt in a candle the other day and it is now distinctly disheveled. A rather cold and moist day here. not actually raining, but doing its best to do so. It is all very quiet except for the usual artillery strafe which is normal and I think things have gone back to their usual state for the time. Rather curiously there was an aeroplane messing about at 3 a. m. this morning. It was a brilliant moonlight night and I suppose it thought it might pick up some information. It just dropped a few lights and then disappeared and I don't know whose it was our own or the Hun. I am very glad to hear about the pram's injuries that the defects were not very serious. I had imagined that it was much worse and that the bearings and such like things had seized. I am sorry she is contin- uing to give trouble, but that is very likely because the Oxted motor man had put her together badly. I take it that he was to blame because the gear rods went wrong and I know there used to be 8 nuts on the gear box or is it 6 anyhow the full number and he has probably collared them. I am very glad you didn't have to change the wheel yourself when you got a puncture, as it is a hand skinning job and I haven't got the proper tool to do it. One really wants a long tool, a box spanner, to get at the nuts inside and there isn't one. with that, which should be quite easy to get, and the jack there ought to be no difficulty. The latest return which the authorities are now calling for is to the rats in the trenches. This has caused some little joy in our otherwise monotonous existence. Of course the rats are innumerable and of all sorts as described in the Pied Piper and how we are to tell if they increase or diminish is more than I can say. Their name is legion and really I don't mind them so long as I don't tread on them and I expect they do a lot of good as they should be useful as scavengers. The other fauna of the trenches consist chiefly of cats, which I suppose used to belong to the cottages that were about the place, an occasional mouse and all sorts and conditions of birds. We have just had sent us a large .450 elephant gun with which to strafe the Hun. His snipers here fire from behind loopholes and are constantly rather hard to cope with, as when he has fired he shuts up his loophole and defies you. However a .450 bullet doesn't care a hang for loopholes and goes straight through whether closed or open, so we have strafed all the loopholes we can see. and they haven't fired a shot since. Our snipers are pretty useful and we often find that they have a lot of good targets on the first day we are in, but after that they can do nothing as the Bosch doesn't make himself very evident, which is all the better for us but rather dull for the snipers. Of course sniping can now be nothing to what it was, as they can't get behind our lines as they used to, and all the high points houses and trees and such like from which they might fire behind their own lines, are blown to bits. I don't expect that I shall be able to send off a letter to-morrow but will write the next day I hope you get news of Glad. soon Love to all Jack. ",1916-02-18,Father
"My dear Family, I didn't hear from you yesterday, but I suppose the Prodigal Daughter got on the jaw, so you had no opportunity of writing. There is no news here. It snew violently all this morning and is rather chilsome and I am very glad I am not at the moment in the trenches. These guns round here are fairly on the hop and each one makes more noise than the last and they won't stop. I can't imagine why they ever put infantry in this place, as we are surrounded by batteries, and of course the Hun strafes the batteries and when he misses them he gets us, though don't imagine from this that we live in an atmosphere of smoke and shrapnel, because we don't and up to now the Bosch has not actually hit the ground within 200 yards of us and then only twice yesterday when he did some very accurate shooting into an open field about 200 yards away, only unfortunately for him there is nothing there except beetroot. We had some gas shells some little way off yesterday which make one's eyes water abominably. They don't do any harm otherwise. but I imagine that you can't see at all if you get caught by them properly. We have spectacles which are supposed to prevent it, but I doubt if they are much use -- as you are into the gas before you know its there and by the time you've got your goggles on the deed is done. I am going into Poperinghe to-morrow as I want to come to an arrangement with the Expeditionary Force Canteen there as to running our own little coffee shop, which has proved a tremendous boon to the men up here, as we can't get enough up before it is sold out at once. Of course the men get much more for their money as we are not out to make a profit but the brave little Belgians rob them unmercifully. Another difficulty has arisen in that we can't get sugar. Why, I don't know, so I have to compromise on the native sanded grit, which passes for the real article here. Love to all Jack. ",1916-02-21,Family
"My dear Mother, It is your turn for the news to-day. Many thanks to Olive for a letter from Invergordon and to Cecily for Punch. No mail came in yesterday and I expect there will be others to acknowledge when it arrives. We came into the trenches two nights ago, but only finished this relief about 4 a. m. as we could not start at the usual time on account of other reliefs going on. It has been pretty cold since we have been in and there is plenty of snow on the ground and it looks as if more is coming. However we manage to keep pretty warm, and there is no wind. The Bosch is very quiet at the moment, though he is very busy working in his front line opposite us and we have accordingly been strafing his new work to-day. Some aeroplanes have been over dropping bombs on Ypres, why I don't know as there doesn't seem to be much there to drop bombs on, but they dropped them and the bombs went off, so I hope they are satisfied. I fear there is nothing to tell you, as nothing is happening beyond the usual routine. They seem to be a bit noisy away to the flanks, but here it is absolutely quiet. I can't make out what the Bosch is up to, after all these little attacks he has made. It looks rather as if he was feeling for place to go for, but I don't think he can be very satisfied with the result. Anyhow he has not progressed very far anywhere and his losses must have been pretty heavy. I don't know when we shall be going out again but I think we shall be in a day or two longer than usual as the other Battalions seem to be doing the same. All the recent attacks seem to have upset the ordinary routine and it takes time to settle down again. Love to all. Jack. ",1916-02-26,Mother
"My dear Father Many thanks for yours of the 25th received last night and for another box of cigars, on which I will report as requested, but at the moment I am only half way through the last box. so I will keep the others in reserve for the present. I see I drew a cheque for my Comm. Union Premium on the 17th ult and I am pretty sure you have the receipt; I think you said it was in your safe. I am writing this on Monday, but there is to be a show on on the right to-night and consequently there will be no transport up and no post out, and as we are to be relieved to-morrow night, I shall again have no opportunity of sending this off and it will probably not go till Wednesday. The Bosch is evidently making a supreme effort Verdun way -- they say he has 600,000 men there to make the push with. Still everything is normal here, and I should think there would be some signs of life if it was necessary to make a counter attack. I can just hear guns going like beams down in the south, which I suppose are the French -- I think I might hear them as the wind is more or less southerly. The snow has gone, but the ground is in a filthy condition in consequence and it is not yet much warmer. I don't think there need to be any fear of gas up in the end of the salient, as they would be just as likely to gas their own men down the sides as ours and in any case we are quite prepared for gas in any form. A very interesting summary of information from a deserter has come round lately and they say that for a Bosche, he is fairly truthful. He states that our light artillery is much better than theirs, which is rather a surprise. Apparently the Hun bursts his shells fairly frequently among his own men, but such an occurrence is rare with us. he also states that the gunners are very often drunk and that the discipline of his crowd is very lax. They have been punished by having their leave stopped but they refuse to go out on patrol when ordered and generally seem to do very much as they like. He is a Saxon and I daresay they are worse than the others, but I had heard recently of several occasions on which they have had mutinies over the way, so their condition must be very much changed from what it was at the beginning of the war. The strafe to-night is intended to retake our trenches which the Bosch still occupies and I fancy they ought to do it all right. Love to all Jack. ",1916-02-28,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter of the 1st and also for one from G. I think I have already acknowledged G's cake, which was very nice and saved several hides as we were starving when we got it. Yours has not arrived yet, though I expect it is in the post and that it I will get it to-morrow. I have had a book from C. and the strand from Odd, for which my gratitude. As I am at the moment in the land of books, please don't trouble to send any for the next few days as there is a book shop next door which supplies everything from the Spectator to the Vie Parisienne -- at a price - and which will probably continue to do so unless the Bosch drops a bomb or shell on it, which he is rather prone to do in this particular place. As you will perhaps gather we have come back for a few days and I came on ahead this morning to take the place over. I imagined that the rest of the Battn. would get back about 10 pm but they are not arriving till 3.30 a.m, so I have got to sit up for them till then. It is a beastly night and pouring with rain, so they will be pretty wet when they do arrive. I am in the town of but I mustn't tell you except that it is the only inhabitable town I ever mention in my letters. The Hun has taken to strafing it lately, so the inhabitants are clearing out and we occupy their beds. My own landlord appears to have a very good spring mattress, which I shall occupy later on. There are a number of shops here and the Expeditionary Force Canteen and a troupe of Pierrots called the Fancies, who I believe are very good, so we are quite civilised and were the Hun not so obnoxious, it would be quite a pleasant spot. The authorities of the place are extraordinarily keen about not showing any lights, as the Zepps are wont to mooch about by night and drop things. so all the windows have to be carefully screened. but this would be necessary anyhow, as all the windows are broken and the rooms are a bit draughty accordingly. Unfortunately our billets are right at the other end of the town to the Town Major's, who runs the place and he obviously lives in the spot which gets the least strafing, so we must pray that we don't get any unwelcome attentions from the Bosch. Tell G. that I will come home as soon as possible. only as I've said before there is no leave going at the moment. Love to all Jack. ",1916-03-03,Mother
"My dear Family, Very many thanks for various parcels and papers yesterday. A cake and other things from G. and W. a cake from Mother and John Bull from Cecily. I am still where I was and had an idle day as most of the Battn. was out on a working party last night, so they are allowed to rest by day afterwards. I had a little jaunt this afternoon with the C. O. in a car to see an exhibition of trench mortars firing blank. I think it was chiefly designed to amuse the staff, who were there in large numbers, but we get much better displays in the trenches. There was a new gun there which struck me as being very useful -- in fact it fires so fast that you can get 5 rounds in the air with it at once and another French gun, which is very portable and should be very useful. There has been a good deal of snow again with a North wind and is decidedly chilly in consequence. I had a bath this morning, the first for a long time and feel quite respectable in consequence. I am afraid you have all had to cry off the pram owing to Petrol scarcity, which is a pity, but I suppose there is nothing else to do. Perhaps they will devise some means of letting one get some occasionally - and I see from the Autocar that there is some such scheme at foot. ",1916-03-06,Family

"My dear Mother, Many thanks for yours and Fathers letters which I got yesterday. We have had a beautiful day to-day with a hot sun and I sat out for ½ an hour and basked in it, if you can call it basking when the surrounding country is an arid plain and the only objects in view a number of very smoky ash-heaps. However it is the nearest we can get to basking here. Congratulations to C. on singing at the R. A. M. concert -- I shall look out for the press Notices. To day we went to church in the Divisional Cinema across the road, where a very sloppy young parson came to preach to us. A bad exchange for Frossard who has gone to the base thank goodness. This afternoon I have been there again to look at the Cinema show, which is not at all bad. Many thanks for a John Bull and two cakes which arrived yesterday. The latest rumor is that there is to be no more leave till June or July, so there you are. anyhow it is quite possible, as there was none up here all last summer, so G. had better make her own plans and push off to Erin as soon as she likes. I don't think I shall be able to give any definite idea whether there is likely to be any, till it is definitely announced. Would you ask Father if he would send out the Field Glasses -- I hoped that I should have been home by now to bring them back. The aeroplanes are very busy overhead, but there have been no air fights so far as I could see. Love to all from Jack. P. S. How is the plot of land getting on? P. P. S. The National Review has arrived, but please don't worry to send it, as we get it already. ",1916-03-12,Mother
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for the bundle of woolen things which arrived yesterday and which I am distributing, though I am keeping a pair of socks for myself. They were so beautiful, I couldn't part with them. The parcel included mittens and mufflers, but I doubt if these are wanted any more now -- socks are the permanent need. I hear that we are going out of the salient soon and we have had 6 months of it, so it is only fair that someone else should enjoy its amenities. We have had another beautiful day, part of which I have spent in the Divisional Cinema, which is running regularly now and has the very latest films out weekly, so we are very up to date. That great Drama ""On Military Service"" was very enthralling and met with great applause. I hope the kitchen is in working order again. I am afraid you have had rather a game in shifting into the Greyhound for meals -- but perhaps the new range will enable all the family to have 2 hot baths a night each instead of only one as heretofore. Intense excitement, as it appears that a working party of ours has gone off in some busses, which were ordered for someone else and their own wagons have turned up and of course there is no one to take and no one knows who the busses were for. So someone is now thanking his stars that his conveyance has not arrived and is marching his men back into camp. Love to all. Jack. ",1916-03-14,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letter and the watch which arrived by the same post. A new watch in exchange of the other is distinctly luxurious. not that the other wasn't as good as one could want till it went wrong. I will do exactly as G. wishes about changing them. I am afraid the original one is rather scratched, but so will this one be by the time she gets it and I doubt if there will be a pin to choose between them by the time the other is repaired, and it will save trouble if I stick to this. I am quite sure these are the best watches going, as I notice that everyone else buys those protectors which are advertised, or are constantly breaking the glass. I had no time to write yesterday, as I spent the day in showing various people round the line. We came in two nights ago. To-day I am going to try and fix up a new Headquarters in some old dug outs belonging to the Battalion next door. They cleared out a few days ago, as they thought them unhealthy, the Bosch having dropped a few crumps near by but I am pretty sure that he was aiming at a new support trench of ours, which has been recently built quite near by and which evidently looked too young and innocent to please the Bosch, so he strafed it and pretty successfully too. The last 2 days have been very warm and springlike and life in a dugout is quite pleasant. Yesterday was cloudy but to-day is bright and the aeroplanes are strafing away overhead. One of ours came down behind here just now, I suspect because of engine trouble, as it came down very slowly, but every machine gun in the Hun trenches was turned on to it and the wretched airman must have had a poor time. Two Hun aeroplanes are overhead, looking for him I suppose and when found they will set to work on him with shrapnel and whizz-bangs. I was interested to hear that you had the chance of going for the Conscientious Objectors, as it would have been rather fun The C. O. suggests that they should be formed into wiring parties, to go out in front of the line and make up the barbed wire. They wouldn't want arms, as there would be a covering party in front and nothing could be more in the course of peace than to put obstacles between 2 parties who are supposed to be most anxious to get at each other. Incidentally they would discover something about the beloved Prussian and possibly stop a bullet or two intended for the better men behind. There is no more news about leave and I have no idea when it is to begin again. One can't see any reason for it at the moment and it may be that the C. in C. doesn't think that warfare and leave are compatible and consequently that there won't be any more. Love to all Jack.

"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letter and the glasses, which are A1. Also to mother for her letter and an Autocar. I am sorry her foot is troubling her and hope the pram will help her to get about. Also to G. and W. for food and drink. The latter went down very well on the last night I was in the trenches and I hope in the salient and we buzzed the bottle and to C. and O. for letters. I am very glad C did so well at the concert and I daresay there will be more soon to disport herself at. Leave has really started and we are sending a batch to-day and another at the end of the week and so on at 4 day intervals, so I really do think I may be back soon, but even now I cant say exactly when. I went over in a bus yesterday to our new billeting area near Bailleul and found someone else arranging to billet his people in the same place as mine. However on returning I got him turned out and I suppose he is now scouring the countryside for more billets and I know there aren't any. However it won't do them any harm, as he is a Field Ambulance bloke and they sit on their latter ends and twiddle their thumbs and for the most part might as well be back at home. Though of course they keep a certain number up the line. The new place is in more or less hilly country and is much more attractive than this and the people are French and very nice -- at least they were to me yesterday and I expect they will be to the men. On my way down the other night I stopped in Wipers and had a look round the Cathedral and Cloth Hall, but it is difficult to see anything to bring away, as the floors are covered with the vaultings of the roof. However I got a few bits of green glass out of the doors of the Cloth Hall and a bit of alabaster and bit of painted wood out of the Cathedral, but they are nothing very definite and might just as well have come out of the Station or any ruined place. I have got to go in charge of the Brigade Transport to-day to the new area -- a rotten job, as there is about a mile of it and they all leave the column at different and probably the wrong places and the guides which are to meet them will either not be there or if there be unable to guide -- guides out here always are like that. Yesterday on our journey we passed an aerodome and it was very curious at dusk the way the machines dropped in out of nowhere and absolutely quietly and ambled off to their sheds. Did I tell you that in the Intelligence the other day some machine was reported, I forget whether ours or a Bosch to have been seen to loop the loop six times in succession and for no apparent reason. Pure lightheartedness I suppose. Love to all Jack. ",1916-03-21,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your last letter. I hope your foot is all right now, and if not that the pram is still useful as a conveyance. We are now in France, which sounds as though we have gone a long way but really it is not much more than 4 miles from where we were before. Still we are in hilly country which I thought very pleasant when I first saw it, but am beginning to change my mind as I plough my way round to the billets and have to climb to them by the muddiest lanes imaginable. It is also beginning to snow again, which is not a pleasant change after last weeks warmth and sunshine. We should be here for a few days before moving up and I do not expect we shall be in the trenches for 10 days at least. I had an uneventful journey with the transport yesterday except that the Brigade Machine Gun Company did all it knew to lose its way. I found it originally with its nose pointing up the wrong road and facing the wrong way. they are new to the country and don't appear to be very intelligent. They also managed to kick and lay out a padre who was with the column, why I don't know, but I don't mind much as I know him and he won't be a great loss. I have got a very good feather bed and spring mattress in my billet, so I am quite all right and we have come into a country that was previously inhabited by Canadians who seem to have made themselves very agreeable. Unfortunately they don't sell whiskey here, as they never do in the area where the Canadians are so I had to send to Poperinghe for ours to-day. Love to all Jack. ",1916-03-22,Mother
"My dear Mother, I think I must owe you a letter and hope your foot is all right. We are still in billets on the borders of France and not likely to move for one or two days. I was to have gone up this morning to look at the place we go to next, but though we waited for some time no one has arrived to take us, so I didn't go. This afternoon I have been studying the country round from the top of an exceeding high hill, from which one gets a wonderful view to the North and East. It was very clear and the sun shone from time to time and we saw the Dunes on the sea coast near Nieupoort and Dunkerque and Ostend in the distance. While nearer by Dixmude and Furnes -- while all the country we have been in for so long was nearer still and Wipers itself seemed no distance. One could trace the line a good deal of the way, as it looked like a desert in the middle of the cultivated area. We could also see the shells bursting at different points and they were putting a lot of shrapnel over the place we have just come from and in places one could see the flashes of the Bosch guns. There is another hill much nearer to the Hun lines further up and I hope to get up that sometime to view the landscape over, as one can see everything the Bosch does from it and his artillery is very inactive in consequence because he gets spotted directly he fires and we can put his guns out of action pretty easily. The G. O. C. said he was coming round this morning, but failed to materialize as usual, so we had to try and do without him! Please tell Father that the glasses are marked with half an arrowhead, which means that they are not passed for Government service. However there is no fault to find with them, except that there must be a small flaw in one of the prisms, as one can see a small crack running across the edge of the right eye piece when looking through it. The flaw doesn't seem to affect the vision at all, as the glasses are beautifully clear. We have just got a new cook for the mess, who in private life is a chef. So we are now living in luxury, comparatively speaking, but he hasn't got all the materials he needs or utensils he is accustomed to. However we have a written menu at night's beginning with ""Hor. d oeuvres"" and ending with Angels on Horseback and he certainly surprises one by his efforts. In comparison the old cook, who has been tactfully (I did it) transferred to the transport, his meals are as those of the Piccadilly to the Black Dog. The new cook was a Sergeant at one time, but as he was no use as such, he was reduced to the ranks and I collared him outside the orderly room and compelled him to come in. I have now succeeded in palming the mess off on our Doctor, so I am now at liberty to strafe him, if things are not as good as they might be, which I could hardly do when I was supposed to be running it myself and I am a rotten bad housekeeper. Love to all Jack. ",1916-03-25,Mother
"My dear Odd, It was so good to see your fist again. Thanks so much, dearie, for writing, as you write such a lot that I wonder you have time to do anything else. Also please thank Mother for an Autocar and Cecily for some periodicals and Mrs. Barrow for a pair of socks. A cake arrived to-day also for which I offer my best thanks, but it is of the currant and almond variety and not sponge to which you refer, so I daresay yours are on the way, unless perchance they are the real cause of the sinking of the Sussex in mid-channel, being so solid. However I will wait and see. I have been sitting on the seat of justice to-day, on a Court Martial and dole out varying terms of oakum picking, floggings, and in one case a bath of boiling oil. To-morrow I am going up to look at our new positions and the day after we go in I gather that the district is quite pleased and you can be out and bask in the sun even 30 yards behind the front line and at the back you can do exactly as you like except on the rare days when the Hun gets busy when you retire below and meditate. This is the last page of my writing block, so I cant write any more, which is a better excuse for ceasing to write than you can give, my fair one. I hope D. W., W. P., and if there is no exceptional strafing and the leave boats are running and I don't get torpedoed in the channel, to meet you all on Saturday next -- I trust it will not prove an April fool. anyhow wd. someone mind taking an appointment with G. Hern Esq. during the week following and I want to see Caroline and A Kiss for Cinderella somehow. Will someone get me a ticket or two for these. I will stand the racket and take you all to both if you will come. Love to all Jack. ",1916-03-25,Odd
"My dear Family, I have again moved and am now in a farm house about 600 yards behind the line, but as it lies in a secluded hollow and the Bosch is over the next edge or more or less so, it has not been strafed and except that the windows are mostly broken and the roof is not so good as it was, by reason of shrapnel I suppose we are quite comfortable. We marched from our last place this morning and the C. O. and I came on here, but the Company also coming here mayn't arrive till dusk, as they would probably be seen on the way, so on arrival we had to spend some time collecting wood for the fire as there is no coal. While here the Battalion is split up among 3 farms in an area of about a square mile. and they all seem quite comfortable and extraordinarily quiet. However I notice that the Hun had strafed a cottage on the way up, which was quite all right yesterday, so he is not absolutely muzzled. I think it was probably because the last crowd here had a parting go at him just before they went and chucked over everything they could from mere bombs to 9"" crumps and he had to do a little in reply. There is no reason to revise my yesterday's estimate of our reunion viz. Saturday prox, so please expect me then and please make sure that the water is hot because I shall need a bath Love to all Jack. ",1916-03-28,Family
"My dear Mother, I find I forgot to put back the Field dressing in the pocket of my tunic when it came back from being cleaned. would you mind sending it out to me? It is a small oblong brown package about 4 inches by 3. I also owe 2 /- to the bootmaker in the Square, Idens successor and shall be much obliged if someone will pay it. To-day is fearfully wet and everyone is in their huts in consequence. Our mess is extremely uncomfortable, as it leaks and we have 2 chairs and one form to accommodate the lot. However I have a very good bedroom in a house 200 yards off with an arm chair, so I am lucky. I think I only have the arm chair because the room was previously occupied by a General of sorts and no-one else has discovered the place or the furniture thereof The men are pretty well off, as there is a Y. M. C. A. in the place and also a Canteen run by the Brigade -- but beyond that, it offers no attractions. However we can get back to Bailleul for an occasional outing and I think I shall have to get there this afternoon. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-11,Mother
"My dear Father, I am very sorry to have heard of the accident but am very glad that you and Mother are not hurt. I shall be glad to hear how it happened though I suspect another car coming out of a side turning or something of the sort. Anyhow I hope you will drive again without feeling the effects. Yrs in haste Jack ",1916-04-13,Father
"My dear Mother, I do hope you are not badly shaken after the pram accident. I got full particulars to-day from Father and am very glad it was no worse. You might have had a very nasty smash, but as it is you have got off lightly. I am glad the pram is not badly hurt. Many thanks to C. and G. for their letters. I have had a pretty busy time the last 2 days, as I am acting adjutant for the moment. We are moving up to-night. Things are quite quiet at the moment I fancy but one can't tell for certain from here If only the weather was decent, it would be quite pleasant, but it is beastly cold and inclined to rain. I am sending home a pair of breeks which I never use to be sold or given away or used as you like It is no good carting them about here Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-14,Mother
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter enclosing G's received last night. I hope you have recovered from the accident by now. It must have been something of a shock. I fear I have been remiss for 2 days in not writing, but really I have not had a moment, as the first few days of a job like this are rather busy as one hasn't got the hang of things and has to pick up all the threads. However we have carried along so far without any great disaster, though I am every minute expecting to be called up by some irate individual to know why my return of rum jars or some such important article has not been received. We have had 2 very quiet days in the trenches, though they shelled the front line a bit to-day. We are living very comfortably in a cabaret within 500 yards of the front line, but down behind a hill and though the village is strafed to bits this place is at present untouched. Though the roof is a little draughty. The aeroplanes as usual afford amusement and some of ours were out last night dropping coloured lights -- quite picturesque. Cold but bright Love to all Jack ",1916-04-16,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your and Odd's letters received to-day. also for the seeds, which I will plant and let you know how they do. The gaiters have also come also your cheque. It occurs to me that you might just as well keep a little money for me, as you are always getting things and I think I might be allowed to pay all postage on other parcels as well, as it is obviously pretty heavy. When the cheque which I enclose is exhausted I will send another, so will you please take out of it cost of seeds and other things I owe for and insist that I pay for postage as suggested. I now want some regimental badges. not officers but the yellow cap badges the men wear. We can't get them issued out at the moment, but it is quite easy to get them privately and I should like 2 dozen They cost about 4 d each. Peter Bye has returned, so I shall be returning to my normal position of looker on at once. Everyone was recalled from leave last week. no one could understand why and it now appears to have had something to do with Easter traffic and was really a big mistake. It seems very hard on those who got home and had their leave cut off, harder than on a number of men we sent on leave and who got stopped at Boulogne and sent back, as I imagine they will be sent next time instead, and get their full 8 days. Our attached officer has arrived. He is not a bad fellow and tries to make himself pleasant, but he reminds one irresistibly of my orderly room clerk when he speaks. He only arrived at about 9.30 pm and the C. O. and I were just going round so we took him up at once. It was very curious watching him, as I was in the same position myself 6 months ago and he was very perturbed when we explained to him that it was a very quiet night. It was, as things go. but I can imagine that one would think it a most infernal din if one wasn't more or less used to it. He is very unimaginative and we showed him a place where we have a man at night holding a string, the other end being held by a listening post, 2 men, about 30 yards out in front. he pulled the string and when it was pulled from the other end, he was much impressed and wants to know if we had any men out in front. I believe he thought the string led over to the Bosch lines, so that we could communicate with them. Another book arrived last night from G. for which I am grateful though I have not had the chance to read much this week. Still windy cold and wet. I think the weather was better last January. Love to all Jack. P. T. O. While Wardill is at it, he might make the pram's acetylene lights to go. The Reservoir for carbide is I think in my room if not on the footboard. the pipes on the car are clogged I fancy Jack. ",1916-04-18,Mother
"My dear Mother, I have several things to acknowledge. A Tatler Autocar and other papers, gaiters socks and seeds, if I haven't acknowledged them already. We are now out of the trenches and living in farms and houses further back, though still quite close up as our present Headquarters are not more than 400 yards from our last. We are supposed to take care not to show ourselves as though we are hidden from the Hun. he puts a balloon up behind his lines and is supposed to be able to see all round here from it. I doubt if he can see this place anyhow as he has left it severely alone up to now. He was doing some very good shooting at a farm about ½ mile behind us this morning and I saw several shells go right in clouds of red dust from the bricks. The place is quite uninhabited so no one minds how much he strafes it. I went this morning to look at the farm we were in when I came home on leave. The people who succeeded us used to do physical exercises outside in the open in the morning and of course they got spotted and the whole place has been pretty badly knocked about since. Of course it is empty now, but it was a great pity as there are very few of these farms left intact now and if they go on at this rate, we shall have nowhere to go. The natives describe this division as mad, because they strafe the Hun with their guns so much, and of course he strafes us, and incidentally the natives back. I fear the days we are back will be horribly boring, as one can do nothing except wander about in the fields The men all go out at night on working parties which assemblies I do not attend, so they want a rest in the day. We live alongside a very important main road but unfortunately there is no traffic along it these times and there is so much wind that there are not even aeroplanes to amuse. I am glad that the question of repairs to the pram is settled. I wonder if the insurers are coming down on the people in the cart. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-21,Mother
"My dear Father, I am very distressed at your accident. It is an awkward thing to happen and especially now when you are so shorthanded. I have not heard how you did it and I hope that the horse didn't kick you. I hope you will be able to manage a few days holiday so as to give it a chance at the start anyhow. However I'm afraid the weather won't attract you away from home anyhow not if it is like what we are having, as it is too beastly for words at the moment. I have been back near our Transport lines on a gunner F. G. C. M. Their ideas of discipline are very different to ours and they appear to be run in a very haphazard manner. No excitements here. I heard about the Russians in France a long time ago, before I saw you last as a matter of fact and forgot to mention it. One of our Divisional people had been somewhere near where they are and smelt them, so he says. I believe there are more of them in England learning gunning on Salisbury Plain. I was interested to see the result of the Wimbledon Election and that they thought fit to put in that extraordinarily efficient person. I rather expected that K. Jones would have had a closer run for his money. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-22,Father
"My dear Mother Very many thanks for your letter yesterday. It was the first I had heard of Father's accident. At last we have had a change in the weather and it is really jolly. It appears to exhilarate the Bosch as well, as he has been shelling a lot of the farms we live in on the principle I suppose that we should come outside and enjoy the balmy air and if we did not that he would let the balmy air in to us. Anyhow he has been strafing a farm about 300 yards away this afternoon. A lot of crumps came over but he only managed to hit a barn once or twice. When it was over the C. O. Sent up a policeman to see that our fellows didn't go and pillage the place, as the people used to sell eggs and such like there and the police- man has returned to say that the people are still there, so they are evidently used to it. I think we shall emigrate form here to-morrow, as we are too far from most of the Battalion. We shall go to a farm which is further back and hidden from the Bosch, but which suffers from a battery of biggish guns of our own, which make an unearthly did and shake the whole place. Our billet of 3 weeks ago caught fire last night and has been burning merrily to-day, so the Hun is no doubt very pleased with himself. There was no one there however, but he is evidently still watching it as the C. O. and I went to look at it this morning and after we had come away they began on it again. I shan't be sorry to clear out of here, as the roof room has no ceiling except the floor above, as as the upper story is inhabited by the men, the noise below is deafening especially when they do clog dances, when they have to be repressed. The mouth organs are in use all day long. I have just got one of the new steel helmets and look very imposing in it. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-23,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for some magazines form various members of the family last night. I hope to hear that Fathers collar bone is getting on all right. Another fine day and the aeroplanes are buzzing about in swarms. I fancy we have got some new aircraft guns here, as we got 2 of the Bosch planes for certain this morning and they say here that 3 were seen to fall and another one yesterday we brought down in their lines. We move into our new billet to-night and I was round there this morning coping with the inhabitants who speak a mixture of bad French Flemish and broken English. When their French stumped me I tried English in reply and they could often understand. I suppose because the Flemish words are so like ours. The Bosches are still busy on the farm up at the end of the field and have put in 2 or 3 hundred shells there this morning. This time the inhabitants have fled, but their wretched beasts are still in the fields round though they take it all very calmly and don't quite understand the noise. We have got our own men out of the barns at this farm and they are now sitting in the yard, so that they can be put into the shelter trench if the Bosches turn on here. Several of them look exactly like Bairnsfather pictures -- most unalterably bored with the whole thing. It is very clear to-day and one can see the observation balloons belonging to the Hun for a long way down the line. You will let me know sometime what the pram costs to repair and what the insurance people are doing about it. If he can I should like Wardill to fit the electric bulbs in the side lamps so that they don't rattle. He might as well do that when he is doing the rest. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-24,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter yesterday, also for Mother's enclosing Cecily's and Odds. I am very glad you are getting on all right and can tap the Blick without undue difficulty. I also hope you are enjoying the weather, which has been simply perfect the last 2 days. We are in the trenches again having come in last night, and I am back in the same red Cabaret, which is inclined to be rather stuffy, as we have to keep the shutters closed all night, so that no lights are visible which to my mind is an unnecessary precaution as we stroll about outside all day and the Hun can't see us, so I don't see how he could at night. We had an eventful night, as 2 prisoners had come over and frightened the authorities as to possible strafes and as the wind as easterly we were on the look out for gas all night. We did get our warning, which eventually proved to be false. Apparently, it was the Hun who started warning his own men a long way down the line. His alarm was overheard by a patrol of ours who was lying under his wire and so it passed up at once for miles. It was very instructive as it showed how good our arrangements of warnings are -- though it kept me standing about all night which I didn't appreciate so I am going to bed shortly. Just as it was getting dawn I saw a very fine aeroplane fight. We just heard and saw a Hun plane going away back over our lines when it was still half dark, and shortly after he had gone a fast one of ours turned up and chased him. They both reappeared shortly afterwards coming back with ours just behind the Hun and firing when he got the chance. It was very like the pictures one sees in the illustrated papers, as ours was not more than 50 yards behind the Bosch and one could see the spurts of flame from his machine gun. We all thought he was bound to get the Hun, when for some unexplained reason our man turned round and went home -- probably because his machine gun jammed and so he was helpless -- still it was very exhilarating while it lasted. There was quite a good account in the Times a few days ago of this part of the line written by the official Correspondent at G. H. Q. Evidently he was looking over it from a very commanding hill just behind our lines from which you can see most of the Salient and the bit of the line we are in. Things are pretty active up in the Salient, I gather, but I haven't heard that anyone expects a big attack up here, as the Bosch can hardly run 2 big shows at once. I fancy the green tabs the Gunner wears mean some office job and both green tabs and the blue tabs with red stripes which one sees in London, all mean non combatant jobs of sorts though I don't know their exact meanings. Very many thanks for the promise of the regimental badges when they are obtainable. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-27,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your and Cecily's letters which I got last night. We are still basking in simply gorgeous summer weather, and apparently the Hun is enjoying it as well, as on both sides there seems to be nothing doing for the moment. Everything has come out to an extraordinary extent the last few days, which is all to the goods, as it helps to hide the various places we live in behind the line. I hope Father's arm is continuing to progress. I am afraid it is a great handicap to him, if M. E. is away from the office. I shall have the show on my hands to-morrow as the C. O. goes on leave. There is no news of any sort. We are still very much on the alert for gas, as the wind is in the East, and the Bosch tried it on the night before last at Hulluch but with no success. I don't think he is likely to try it on here, but he might on the people a little way off on either side, so we take the necessary precautions These mean incidentally that we don't get all the sleep we might at nights and consequently these Hqrs. do not present a very animated appearance in the mornings. In fact there are 2 of them snoring in unison next door and another at the table here pretending to read a book but really sound asleep. however I notice they all wake up in time for meals. The two Poles who deserted the other day were met on the road back by one of our men, who remarked ""Hullo Fritz"" and the Pole was most indignant ""Me no Fritz"" he said. and added later on when he was examined that there were more who wanted to come over but were afraid, so we are stirring them up to-night with our artillery to make it warm for them so that perhaps more will come over. It is quite a science, the way to strafe the Hun. They start with shrapnel and odds and ends over the ground where the Hun is likely to be. This goes on for about ¼ of an hour, by which time the Bosch will have got under cover in his dug outs. Then we put heavy stuff into his dug outs and then more shrapnel to catch him coming out, by which time he usually gets a little irritated. Love to all Jack. Please tell them not to worry about the prams headlights. ",1916-04-28,Mother
"My dear Mother, I fancy I have a letter from you to acknowledge, for which many thanks. I am very glad Fathers arm is going the normal course and that it is not paining him. The weather is still absolutely perfect and one basks in the sun, but we sleep a good deal by day as circs. keep us awake at night. Last night was distinctly eventful as we were in for the full blast of a gas attack, aimed mostly at the Battalion next door, but they made a solitary attempt to get into our trench. However we threw a couple of dozen bombs at them and they didn't get in. They got in next door however where they had a much better chance, as the ground was very much cut up between the two lines which are only about 50 yards apart there, but were promptly ejected. I suppose by now the Censor will have blue pencilled the whole letter, but perhaps if he will consider how difficult it is to get anything to write about, he will allow a little license on such an occasion as this. Anyhow I will risk it to go on. It was the first time I had used my helmet in earnest and it is most unpleasant as I had it on for an hour or more and ^ it is very difficult to see through, especially at night. The show was on from about 12.30 am to 3, when it died away and has been quite quiet ever since. We had some sort of a warning as some deserters I have previously mentioned said it was expected several days ago and two more came over yesterday and said it was on last night, but it looked rather fishy as they were the second lot who had said the same thing and might easily have been a plant. My part of the show was very small, as I was more or less tied to a telephone at Hqrs. and in the intervals had to send of parties carrying munitions of various sorts with which to strafe the Bosch. Of course had the C. O. been here I should probably have been up in the front, but as he went on leave yesterday afternoon he missed it and will be very sick too. However I am quite glad to have experienced it, though I can't say I'm anxious to do so again. Considering all things, I think we got off very lightly. They must have got a good deal more than they gave however, as they shelled a good deal but so far as we were concerned very ineffectively, and our guns were putting it into them well. What casualties there were were mostly minor cases of gassing which should be cured in a very few days. They have cured us of rats, which is all to the good as I saw any number of them lying about dead when I went round early this morning. Curiously enough there was a dog in the trenches at the time and a cat and kittens down here all of whom are sitting up and taking nourishment. The gas simply burns up all the vegetation where it is strongest and the whole of No Mans Land where it came over is now absolutely withered. Down here 800 yards back the fields are not burnt but have quite lost their freshness and one might easily have been moved on into the middle of September from the look of the fields. I must now cease. Love to all Jack. ",1916-04-30,Mother
"My dear Mother, I am sorry not to have written since the 30th, but I have had a great deal to do. The gas shows entail a lot of reports and interviews and inquiries into our precautions and general dispositions. I had to write endless reports. As yet they know so little about gas that they want to find out everything, so I have laid my soul bare Gas is a fiendish business and our losses are not light but I hope that most of them will return in a day or two when the effects have worn off. Thank goodness this endless East Wind has changed to the West, so we can now rest in peace, as this thing has been hanging over us for some time though I didn't think myself that we should be in more than the fringe of it, whereas we were in the very middle. The Hun has had a relief opposite too which looks as though he has given up any hope of a repetition at the moment. he frightened us considerably on the succeeding night by sending up a lot of smoke, which our neighbours thought was gas but we did not and it wasn't. To-day we have bagged a number of the new regiment of Huns, as they have been showing themselves much to our snipers delight and we got 6. This is a clear indication of the relief, as the last lot never showed a hair above the parapet or a nose through a loophole. We bagged 6 of these Huns at 1600 yards while they were walking across a ridge behind their lines and this is a pretty good shooting. However the Bosch didn't like it and later on smashed one of our telescopic rifles but didn't touch the man behind. We are going out to-night and I shan't be sorry to get back to somewhere where the leaves are green, as the country looks so jaundiced here that it is quite depressing. We have had a heavy thunderstorm this afternoon, which I hope will colour it up a bit by the time we get back. I hear that the natives in the nearest occupied farm about a mile back are clearing out. They don't mind ordinary crumps but gas is a little bit too thick so they are selling their stock and I am meditating the purchase of some fowls only I don't know how to feed the creatures, and one can't transform the transport into a travelling menagerie. It looks like a circus when we move as it is. The Gunners near by have no such qualms and have bought the dog, a calf as a mascot, a cow to provide their milk and numbers of hen to do ditto for the eggs. I shall look out for these when next on trek. It would make you scream with laughter ^ to watch a party of men in gas helmets. They look exactly like so many ducks and they waddle in the same way, as it is very difficult to see out of one, and when you speak to a man you see a whole row of heads turning round and peering up at you, as you can only look straight in front of your face. Each helmet has a tube sticking out from the mouth which looks exactly like a beak -- the men call it a goblin parade when they have to wear them. Love to all. Jack. ",1916-05-02,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letter and the cigars -- the latter are A1 and the former delighted me, as it shows that you can now write. The envelope was a great effort, if written by your left hand, but it is so similar to your usual writing that I imagine you can now use your right hand a bit. We returned last night to find a very subdued and quiet Bosch opposite -- very different from the noisy and blatant Hun, who has been there lately. He hardly fires a shot and we got practically up to our Headquarters last night without any visible signs that there is a war on. We had rain yesterday and more to-day -- evidently that is what the country required as it is getting quite green again and the effects of the gas are wearing off. The strafing has done no good to our cabaret where we live, as it shed a number of tiles and now the wind makes it decidedly draughty. I went round the line this morning, very unpleasant owing to the weather which makes the walking very greasy and difficult. The C. O. returned for lunch to-day, and very disappointed that he missed the show last Sunday week. Mother says that she will no doubt hear from L. Cpl. Cheeseman of other little shows we have been in. As a matter of fact we have been in one and you have heard every word about all I've seen, though he will probably have a lot to say which is absolutely untrue. All these fellows lie like troopers when they get home just to increase the family's admiration for them. I have just seen a letter from him to his Mother which is waiting here to be censored, so he evidently is not coming home. He's a pretty fair rotter anyway. Love to all Jack. ",1916-05-09,Father
"My dear Odd, Very many thanks for your letter yesterday. I hope you will find the new nurses amenable and the patients not too fractious. also that you will get a fair amount of holiday which I fear you won't if there is so small a staff. I have now returned to my original nondescript position, the C. O. having returned off leave. However noone could say I didn't get my fair share as it was great luck his being away while the show was on. Not that there was anything to do, except answer the telephone, still there was the sense of importance which is always gratifying. Everyone seems very pleased with the Battalion, though as I matter of fact they were only attacked by a small patrol. still I can't keep thinking and everything points to the fact that the old Bosch thought we were all gassed and only sent his patrols over to make sure prior to moving over in force and when he found his patrols got strafed he did no more. They've been very nervous at nights over the way since and are evidently expecting someone to come over and have a go at them. There is no news. the weather is fine after a lot of rain yesterday and we are beginning to dry up. I am afraid this house won't keep out the rain, if it continues, as a lot of slates came off the other night. I have just seen my canteen off to go round the line. It goes round in two large packing cases and contains everything from eggs to lime juice. The men appreciate it very much as it varies their diet and a fresh egg and roll for breakfast is very gratifying. The gas show however caught us badly last week as we had 10 francs worth of bread rolls wasted, which diminishes our profits considerably. The Bosches are shy opposite and are not showing themselves -- they are also extremely quiet. Love from Jack. ",1916-05-10,Odd
"My dear Father, I had a most thrilling account from Cecily of your adventure with the clique Foster and Co. I hope you were really rude to him but I'm afraid you weren't. It would have been a splendid opportunity to pull him to bits especially with the whole room with you to help. I've never heard such infernal lip as his. All quiet here though wet and inclined to be cold. I hope you see the Daily Telegraph now. After a long course of the Times and happened to get on to a copy of the D. T. the other day and found quite by chance that it is not a fact that the Bosch is having everything his own way. It was most inspiring and I continue to read it nightly. One of our subalterns, Fellowes, was wounded yesterday fairly slightly I think. He came with Charlie Cressy and two others from Middlesex and were a very good quartette and now we've only got one of them left. We clear out to-night for a spell and go back for an unutterably boring existence for several days to a place where there is even less doing than here. The guns had a big shoot on a farm opposite us yesterday. I think it was a sort of small fort, but they laid it out in fine style -- not that there was much to lay out, but what there was has never ceased to be. The Bosch set to work on us in retaliation but beyond covering the place with mud and spraining one man's ankle by knocking in the parapet on to him, no damage was done at all. I am writing to Gladys by this post. Love to all Jack. P. S. I wonder if Foster and Lewis did really mix their metaphors in the way Cecily says. It must have been priceless. Do send me any cutting out of the local papers about it. ",1916-05-14,Father
"My dear Glad, Many thanks for both your letters describing Ireland and Dublin. I would have written before only I didn't know where you were. For all I know you were S. Fing with Waalum in the Dublin Post Office and doing a little shooting on your own or on the other hand you might both have been in prison. More unlikely things have happened. I was sorry to hear you thought Father looked ill. The break must have been a great shock to him and he has been carrying on as usual ever since. I hope this P. L. business did him good, as though it is rather rotten to be openly attacked by blighters of the Foster type, it was rather a triumph for Father and the enemy were badly routed. I am very flourishing. They roused us from our normal torpor about a fortnight ago by gassing us, as you may have heard, but it didn't do them any good and they are very piano at the moment and daren't show themselves, as if they do we snipe them instantly. Incidentally I fancy I milder sort of bosch has come in opposite us and all he wants is to be left alone. They are supposed to be Saxons, but we haven't yet secured a specimen to see Anyhow they carry on like Saxons Rather curiously the fellow who commands the Battalion that relieves us is a Nigerian. He used to be in command of the native troops round Naraguta and he mentioned the Cocks names, as though he knew them. He liked the place very much and wants to go back to it. Remember me to Lillie and other Aunts Uncles and Cousins, whom you may see. love from Jack. ",1916-05-14,Glad
"My dear Cecily, I think it is your turn for a letter. Many thanks for all your last. I don't know that I have much news except that we have amassed a number of decorations out of the gas show. Peter Bye got the Military Cross, one sergeant the D. C. M. and 5 others the Military Medal -- not bad seeing that nothing much happened. To-day I have done nothing much. I climbed the hill behind us this afternoon to have a look over the Bosch lines, but could see nothing as it was so misty. It was a glorious day so it was very enjoyable up there anyhow. To-night I managed to get a bath, which is always an event. The men had a boxing competition which was quite good sport. A working party from another battalion happened to be burying a cable near by, but the idea of boxing was too much for them, so they came over en masse to look on and even put up one of their own men to compete. However he got knocked over the ropes twice for his pains, but I don't gather that they went back to their work and I must say I don't blame them. The men are made to work far too hard to my thinking, chiefly by people who have never lived in a trench and have absolutely no idea of what they have to do there. Love to all Jack. ",1916-05-17,Cecily
"My dear Glad, Many thanks for a saffron cake and a letter was it! well no on second thoughts I don't think there was a letter, but the cake was excellent. None the less madam write at once so that your beloved brother may realise that there are others who take an interest in him besides the Bosch. There is no news. We have and are continuing to broil in most beautiful sunshine and it is much too hot to strafe. Both sides feel alike on the subject and are very quiet by day. I noticed in yesterday's paper a telegram which said how active things are and it named the very place we are in as being one of the most strenuous. You might imagine from the telegram (in the D. T. I think) that we were living in a hail of shells and bullets and chucking bombs at each other all day with short intervals for meals, whereas we are actually as quiet as mice. so if this place is lively Lord knows how they don't expire of freedom in other places. We had some excitement last night when a Hun aeroplane descended with a nasty smack into some trees behind his line. Unfortunately we can't see him this morning, but there is no doubt the plane is there and we are dropping a little shrapnel about to make it unpleasant for the Bosches who are removing the pieces. Love to Lillie and W. Jack. ",1916-05-21,Glad
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letters and for a box of very good cigars, though I have not yet smoked one as I am just finishing the last box. Please thank Cecily for 2 letters and a paper and Mother for an Autocar. I am glad the pram is recovering. I hope Wardill will see the brakes are relined, as they need it. We had another fine day to-day, cooler than yesterday after a thunderstorm last night. It was very quiet to-day though we heard that the guns had blown up some gas cylinders away on the flank, so they turned on some guns on to the line in our part and they managed to start another couple, showing that the Hun still has ideas on the use of gas. Apparently owing to the wind some of the gas blew over to the Bosch lines and I trust they enjoyed it. We thought the Huns had started another device to-night, as while the C. O. and I were up the line we noticed clouds of smoke coming over the parapet. We traced it to a point about 15 yards from our parapet but couldn't see any reason for it, as it was coming out of the Earth apparently. Naturally we suspected poison gasses or something else equally deadly especially as there was no smell. However after dark they went over to look and find that it was all caused by an old smoke bomb which has probably been out there a long time and got started by a shell splinter, so our fears of underground pipes from the Hun lines to our own and other terrifying ideas are nullified. A bevy of Staff lights came round this morning from the Division and exhibited their usual and absolute ignorance of how a trench should be run. However the Divisional G. O. C. has a good word to say about my report on the gas show, which is all to the good, though how the good man ever got through it I don't know, as it was extremely voluminous and probably only one of thirty others sent to him. Love to all Jack. ",1916-05-24,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter to-day and for the Tatler also for the promise of a cake, on which I will report when it arrives. I am sending home some clothes and boots which I don't want during the summer. They will probably take some little time to arrive, but you should get them before I want them sent out again. We are now out of the line and back in our village home, where the men are supposed to have a rest, but there seem to be any number of working parties going, so I doubt if they get much. I was reading Churchills speech on the army to-day and thought he made a lot of very good remarks. I certainly agree that there are a number of troops in front who do all the work and run all the risk and a very large number behind who do some of the work, run no risk and get all the pay. It seems a truly British arrangement. I think this trench ribbon or button idea, which is only given to the men up in front will be the smallest recognition they can give them and the sooner they can give it the better. I want another 2 dozen lambs -- can you get them and send them out. Do I owe you anything more? Things seem very quiet here at the moment. I think this Hun's pressure on Verdun is a great sign of their difficulties. Their chances of getting through are absolutely nil and yet they go on wasting men and the only reason is so far as one can see, that they can do nothing else. It is an ideal situation. Love to all Jack. ",1916-05-25,Mother
"My dear Cecily, Thanks for a letter from you and G. to-day, also for a cake from Mother which alas arrived in fragments, but I hope that we shall be able to salve most of it. It had obviously been sat on continuously since leaving England. I'm afraid parcels are very liable to suffer like that if they are not put in a box and a pretty strong one too. The ordinary cardboard is not much protection. Please tell Father the Upmanns are very good. I have no news. It is a fine day and I have nothing to do as the Battalion is in various parts of the country working. We have the loan of a gramophone -- one of the His Masters Voice sort but the records are either all musical comedy stuff or good things which we are sick of. Could you hunt up a few for me say half a dozen such as Sibelius Valse Triste, Sindings Frühlingsrauschen (rustle of spring) Griegs Dance out of the Peer Gynt and 3 others of a similar nature. If you let me know what they come to and postage I will send you a cheque. Please address them to Major Fox 72nd Infantry Brigade, B. E. F. as it is his gramophone, but we borrow it when out of the trenches and he keeps it when he is in Love to all Yrs. Jack ",1916-05-26,Cecily
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter yesterday. I am very glad to hear that your arm is so much better and that you can do Special Constable again, and I trust that they won't haul you out of bed at odd hours to do it. Please thank Cecily for a Strand and L. O. and P. S. If she will order the Strand to be sent me monthly I should like it, as we don't get it here. I wonder if you could have a look at a typewriter ^ for me. We want one for the Battalion. It must be strong and not too big or complicated -- to take foolscap size paper and in a leather case. I think something a little stronger and bigger than your own at home (I forget its name) and I don't want to pay more than about £12 -- less if possible. I will send you a cheque, directly I know what it costs. I would write direct to Harrods or some such place only they would be sure to send some- thing quite unsuitable. I rode into our Metropolis yesterday for no particular reason, and came back with some delicacies for the mess. The G. O. C. of our Army comes to-morrow to present medals to the people who got them the other day, so I suppose we shall turn out in force to greet him. I have met him before and he is a nice old thing. I am sorry you have lost Porter and I am afraid you will be short-handed, till you can find a young woman to take his place. Do you notice how the Bosches are reported to be fortifying their lines round Liège etc. I wonder if that means that they are going to retire on to a shorter line, as Hilaire Belloc has suggested so often. Can someone get me a new khaki tie, not knitted. and not too light in colour. I will send a cheque for odds and ends like this when I can find my cheque book. Love to all Jack. ",1916-05-28,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for various letters and papers and the cake, which I fear was rather crushed but otherwise very good. There is no news, as we are still back behind the line and probably having too much to eat and smoke and too little exercise. The G. O. C. of the army came round this morning and gave away ribbons to various people who have won medals from time to time - and made the usual little speech expected of such luminaries. It is very curious how they are awarded, as each recipient has his deed of valour read out to the congregation assembled, and the comparison between the accounts as read out and the actual facts as known is very curious. When One man a Doctor got a Medal for the way he looked after the wounded under heavy shell fire and I know for a fact that on the occasion in question he never left his dressing station, and his arrange- ments were as bad as they could have been and if there had really been a shell anywhere near him there would have been a lot of casualties among his patients, as they were all sitting out in rows waiting to be attended to. Really there wasn't a shell anywhere near him, but I suppose he talked big when he got back and his superior Doctor recommended him for absolutely nothing. As far as I can see anyone who chooses to come back and tell a good story after these shows can get something, as there is probably no one to say whether he is telling the truth or not. Still his is a particularly blatant case. Remember me to Aunt Katie. When do G. and W. think of returning to the jungle? Love to all Jack. ",1916-05-29,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for yours of the 28th. I got one from Odd by the same post and also a Bystander from Cecily. I am glad the Red Cross show went off all right and that the pram is on her way to complete recovery. I hope you get down to Aldenham in her some time or other. There is no particular news. We are back in the line again and it seems fairly quiet except for those infernal minenwerfer which they trouble us with from time to time. The things they throw are colossal great bombs, bear shaped and weighing about 220 lbs each, and make a terrific din when they go off though they seem to be mostly noise unless they get right into a trench when they damage it a bit. I am glad to hear the war is to finish in the autumn, as it is a good thing to have it decided! I have guessed at February as a likely moment for some time now. The Brigade keep a book of guesses and have kept it now for some time. They have had to scratch off a lot of people already who guessed a date before this The earliest guess they had I think was last Xmas and they have nothing over Xmas 1917. I suppose G. and W. will have returned to the fold by the time you get this. Give them and Aunt Katie my love. Yrs. Jack. ",1916-05-31,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters to-day from you, Cecily, Gladys and a letter card from Father. I will let him know what the records are like when I hear them. Meanwhile many thanks for ordering them. I enclose a cheque for £5. Will someone please administer it for me and continue to pay for things and postages out of it and also pay what I owe already. A glorious First of June and fairly quiet except that we set to work on the Bosch opposite with big guns and must have livened him up pretty considerably. An excitement is on at the moment, as somebody's balloon is adrift and it is being strafed by both sides, impartially. The wind is more or less up and down the line so I can't say where it came from, but I fancy the Bosch is going to get it. The shooting at it is paralytic, but none the less unpleasant for the bloke in the basket -- if there is one. I am sorry to hear that Alan is hit. I hope not seriously. I forget what Battalion he was in. The guns have been very busy away down the line to-day, but whether they were our guns or the Bosches or where they were firing I don't know. I t seemed very intense while it lasted and someone has apparently got a new sort of gun which fires much quicker than most. Let's hope it is ours. Love to all Jack The lambs have arrived safely. Thanks. ",1916-06-01,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for sending of the typewriter and for the note about using it. I will let you know how it goes when we get it but it sounds as if it is just what we want. I am telling Cox to send you a cheque, which you should get shortly. I am much obliged to you for your trouble. The tie has also arrived but Mother will no doubt provide for that one out of my money. I have also got a Strand and other papers from Cecily. I hear the Bosch got into the trenches we last occupied in the salient last night. I fancy the authorities will be pretty sick with their defenders as they are anything but unimportant. However the latest news this evening is that he is being bombed out again, so I hope all is well. Certainly things appeared to be very lively up there last night. However the liveliness has not extended as far as this, and things are very quiet here, with a lovely summers day and a fresh breeze. I see Alan's name in the paper to-day. You said that he was grazed by a bullet and then returned to the fight, from which I conclude that he is in this Vimy show as I don't know of any other fighting going on at the moment. Possibly he was touched by a stray behind the lines somewhere, as there are plenty of them about and it is behind the lines that most bullet wounds are caused when there is no strafing going on. Please make it quite clear on your envelopes which Battn. mine is as there are others not far away and I see we are getting some of their letters and perhaps they are getting ours. I can't say I've missed any yet but it is well to make sure. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-03,Father
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter. If it's nightingales you are looking for you should come out here. The birds haunt the place in flocks and make such a row that one has to shout to make oneself heard -- the loudest Minnie is as nothing compared to one which disports itself outside my tent when we are in Brigade reserve and barks at me like a dog all night. Peace reigns over the land at the moment though they appeared to be in trouble round Hooge way during the morning as the guns were going like anything. Did I tell you the story of our Divisional G. O.C. who made a pleasant little speech at the official opening of our Cinema the other day and directly he had finished the padre who runs it got up and said ""To-morrow night we shall have Charlie Chaplin."" Unfortunately only a few of them appreciated the remark. I see they are going to beard cousin Bertie in his den at the W. O. I wonder who the brave spirits are and what he will say to them. something fairly pointed I expect. Please thank Cecily for Mrs. B. of New York. I will let you know about the records when I have heard them, meanwhile I am writing to various firms about a gramophone for our canteen and I will find the list of records very useful. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-03,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last letters and to-days Autocar. We had a very interesting little strafe last night, as someone thought that they would like to startle the Bosch, so they turned on a lot of artillery and other engines on to a certain part of his front at a given moment which of course we knew and he did not. It was very interesting to watch when it began as the whole place suddenly burst from comparative peace into a most unholy Din. At the said moment I saw all the sky behind light up at once with the flashes of the guns and then I heard the big fat shells whispering their way through the air above and then at once the pip-squeaks nearer by and then one could distinguish nothing as the noise of all the guns reached one. Then the whole line of Bosch trench became illuminated and it was quite interesting to watch for a few seconds, till the old Bosch woke up and got his guns going in reply and then I found I had urgent business within the depths of a very strong dugout which we inhabit on such occasions, where I stayed for some considerable time with occasional peeps to se the state of the weather. Some shells one can trace going through the air from the sparks they leave, I suppose bits of burning fuze but most of them give no sign till they arrive. When we had done, the Bosch soon quieted down and peace reigned in the air. It is sad to hear about the Navy but it is fairly obvious that those ships sacrificed them- selves so that the whole fleet could have a bang at the Bosch. I expect they will be a bit more cautious in the future. Love to all Jack. P. S. Perhaps the birthday honours list will interest you? ",1916-06-04,Mother
"My dear Mother, Thanks for your letter to-day and for a cake from Cecily which has also come in a rather flattened condition, as it was not boxed. However it will taste none the worse for that. We are now back in our farm which is pleasant, but all among the guns, which are distracting especially when the Hun is trying to drop 5.9's on to them. They are all very busy to-day, I suppose on account of the Hooge business. I sincerely trust the Canadians will get back those trenches they've lost, as in the event of our going up there again, which I suppose is always possible though it is only an idea of my own, we shall want to have back as much as we handed over -- especially as the bit the Huns have collared must make it uncommonly warm for the wretched pedestrians on the roads at the back. I have done nothing to-day except go round the various billets and dug outs where the Battalion hides itself and arrange for a large supply of beer at the Canteen. Love to all Jack. I wonder if someone would strafe Harrods boot dept. on the telephone for me. I ordered a pair of boots a month ago and they came out last week but being much too small I have returned them and written asking for bigger ones. These should have been here by now, but as they have not come I am afraid that Harrods are waiting till the others come back. If they do, I shall not get the new ones till August, as things take a long time to get back, and I think Harrods should send the new ones along at once. As it is I have only got one pair of boots to my name. ",1916-06-06,Mother
"My dear Father, Tis letter should reach you on or about your birthday, so I wish you very many happy returns, and may your next one be spent under more peaceful conditions. There is no news and I have nothing to acknowledge to-day as the English post has failed. However I have heard from Cox and Co that they have sent you a cheque for the cost of the typewriter and I hope you have got it by now and that it is all right. The machine has also arrived and is very good and should suit its work admirably. I don't think it is difficult to manage either. I spent the morning on a Court Martial and this afternoon watching an A. A. gun pooping off at a Bosch plane a long way off and making very good shooting too. It is very sad about Kitchener and no one here would believe it, till confirmed 12 hours after we got the first rumour. However he had done the greater part of his job. I suppose you saw Loraine Pears' name in the list the other day -- C. M. G. Things are very quiet here, though there are noises up Ypres way where they are still strafing. I shouldn't be surprised if the Hun gets Wipers and I should be jolly glad if he did, if we've got to go up that way again, as it is a barren land. I see the Daily Mail talks about the 3rd battle of Wipers but to my mind its all running rot and the Hun has only pressed on his original advantage. I don't see where he is to get the men for a big strafe. Yrs. Jack. ",1916-06-09,Father
"My dear Mother, Another day spent on the farm, though farming has temporarily ceased while a regimental barber is operating on the farmers locks. I suppose there is no one else to do it for him, as the village barbers shop has gone with the rest and its place knows it no more. I got Joseph's letter this morning which Father sent on to me. I have also heard from several other people, George McCausland and Temple and Rosamond Furman and others. I have been busy hunting through Gramophone Record lists, as I have bought one ^ a gramophone for the Canteen and I have had to get some ditties suitable to its audience. However I sent round to get the men's ideas on the subject and they all appear to like something with a moan in it, so I have ordered a lot of the necessary kind, more than I ought I think, as we have no room for the organ in our transport in any case and where the records will go I have no idea. I must now cease to go to a boxing contest. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-10,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for the box of cigars, which has just arrived, though I have not yet opened it, but if like the previous ones, they are very good. Also for going to Hobson's about the ribbon and Harrods about the boots. They did not send the boots at once after all, as apparently my balance there was about 5 /- short, so I have sent them a cheque and perhaps the boots will come along. This Austrian show ought to make the Hun sit up and I fancy it will rather upset his plans. Also I hear this morning that the Canadians have got back all the ground they tried to get back last night, which is most of what they had previously lost. and I suppose they will get back the rest pretty soon. Anyhow there was a most fearful din all last night and early this morning and I imagined something was up. I don't fancy they got many prisoners. There was a memorial service for Kitchener in the Cinema to-day and I went down with the idea of going, but as I had a number of other things to do including a Court Martial, I didn't get there. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-13,Father
"My dear Family, Many thanks to you all for letters from G. and O. a paper from Odd and a bottle of teetotal drink from G. and W. I will see if I can get back before the 16th prox, but I can't say for certain, as though I shall be due for leave before then, I may not get it ""to wance"" as leave is rather short at the moment. However I will do my best. There is no news. Things are very quiet except the usual mutual artillery strafe which continues at decent intervals and never during meal times. I have just heard that as the French are to start daylight saving we are to do the same, and I must put my watch on an hour to-night. so I shall lose an hours beauty sleep to-morrow morning. I hear Newton Binney is somewhere in this district, so I may see him some time shortly. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-14,Family
"My dear Mother, It's a simply perfect day and one can do nothing but bask in the sun, especially as the proprietor of the farm is doing some gruesome work outside the window with a long pole which with which the result of his labours being a sticky liquid which a satellite is pumping into a barrel and a most appalling stench. One is not even safe in one's tent, as other menials are distributing the stuff over the ground in ladles and they appear to like their job though why they don't expire on the spot I can't imagine. The aeroplanes are very active again and they dropped two anti-aircraft shells in our camp this morning without doing any harm except to one man who at once got shellshock. Really the things are quite small and he didn't mind some really big things which were coming over 2 or 3 hundred yards off earlier on and were making a most infernal din. As a matter of fact I thought at the time that the old Bosch had lengthened his range and got on to the farm -- and if he had, he would have done some damage. We were hauled out at 12.30 a. m this morning on a false alarm of gas -- most unwillingly as everything was absolutely quiet and it was obviously a case of cold feet in some sentry's part probably miles off, but we had to stand about for half an hour before going to bed and of course all the gunners were equally annoyed and set to work to strafe the Hun with the result that it tended to spoil one's sleep. However I don't suppose I lost more than a minute or two, as guns cease to trouble after a little practise. Unless they are actually firing over your head when they are a trifle noisy. Here comes the gentleman with the tub again, so I must be off Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-18,Mother
"My dear Glad. Many thanks for your letter from Sywell. I am glad you had such an exhilarating time. I can't guarantee any leave by the 16th, as there seems to be so little going nowadays. However I see you have got a new Mahdi out in Nigeria, which I suppose may mean that Lugard won't have you out there at once. However we will wait to see what the month will bring forth. We are still out of the line and things are quite quiet here, though there is a lot of noise further south which makes one imagine that things are moving down there, but we get no information here. There is nothing in being mentioned in despatches, as they always mention you if you get anything otherwise. As a regiment we didn't do so badly and I fancy as fell as if not better than the other regiments in the Division. However I have not studied the list, as it would take such a time. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-23,Glad
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter, received to-day. I return the License. I don't know why they want it and shall be glad if you will pay the necessary fee and repay yourself from Mother's balance, which she has for me. I suppose the Insurance people will want to get what they can from the waggonette people, but it would be much simpler if they would pay up and not worry further. Cecily told me the pram was running well and I hope you will soon drive it again yourself. I only got the information out of the Gazette. I assumed that someone would write and mention it, but they don't seem inclined to, so I suppose that is all I shall get. They don't seem to give any specific reason for it either, which I thought they always did, so I am still in the dark as to why I got it. The ribbon arrived all right, thanks. No news. We are out of the line and in a farm which they started shelling last night for no reason apparently. However they dropped a whizz bang in the yard outside our front door and then we thought it time to quit. It now appears that there used to be some big guns in this yard and the Hun apparently thinks they are still here. It is quite certain that he was after batteries, as our guns were all having a little bombardment at the time and this was the bosche's retaliation. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-24,Father
"My dear Mother, Very many thanks for your letter to-day, the cutting was a present to me and nothing would induce me to part with it. I expect there are some other copies of the Herald about, if you ask. Please thank C. and G. for their letters and I am also much obliged for the promise of the cake. Odd sent me a very good cake and sponge sandwich yesterday. I have heard nothing of these reports about writing nothing but post cards and I am quite sure no one wants to stop the letters from home, as the mail time is the brightest spot in the day. I trust G. and W.'s portraits will prove to their liking. If they appear in Punch, I trust that the joke will not be in their physionomy, but in the wording attached. I have been round the line this morning and gather that they have been having a cheery time there, as the Hun has been sprinkling them with minnies at 220 lbs of High Explosive a time, and they are quite noticeable when they explode. My new boots have just arrived from Harrods having been nearly 2 months in getting here, also Bubble and Squeak from Cecily for which many thanks. The aeroplanes seem very excited to-day and consequently 2 archies which are living close to our farm are strafing for all they are worth, which means that they will be shelled by the Huns in retaliation which probably means that we shall make a hurried exit from this farm and watch from a safe distance. Such is war. Love to all Jack. ",1916-06-25,Mother
"My dear Glad, Many thanks for letters to-day from Mother Odd and yourself. I am very doubtful about getting home by the 19th as all leave seems to be stopped, but there may be a chance. We have moved camps to-day about a mile and come to a beastly spot, where there is no furniture or tent boards and nothing to sit on and the men have only got small huts with corrugated tin roofs which are as hot as the flames below. What on earth previous occupants have been doing in not improving the place the Lord only knows and we have got to set to work and see what we can do. There is one of our balloons very nearly overhead and I hope the Bosch doesn't come over and do to it what we did to his last week. I can't say what it was but we saw from our billets 3 Bosch balloons descending simultaneously in flames and a fourth being hauled down for all it was worth and that burst into flames before reaching the ground. They strafed them all up and down the front at about the same time and now the old Hun has no balloons so he cant see where he is shelling nearly so well and our balloons are still in full habit so to speak and look ready to burst with pride. ",1916-07-01,Glad
"A lovely day and I have been looking round some trenches near here which we would go to if the Bosch started attacking near here. Incidentally I got a fine view of Wipers and district and didn't notice much difference in Wipers itself though the country looks better in summer dress. I lied about the balloons, as the Bosch has found one to send up, but only one and that is a long way from here A Bosch plane has just been over and chased home again. It was very high up and must have seen nothing. I notice the Bosch Balloon is very low down, so they will be able to pull it in at once if necessary. Our own above also seems a bit nervous and came down directly the aeroplane came in sight. Please thank Father and Mother for letters to-day and ditto yourself for a cake from which arrived quite all right. We have got some chairs out of an estaminet and are more comfortable in the mess. I hear to-day that we have made a good advance down south and quite accordingly to plans I suppose they won't try to rush ahead as they did at Loos but take things quietly. There was a terrific bombardment last night but nothing unusual these times, as all these little raids are accompanied by a lot of gunfire and sound much more impressive that the results would show. One of the prisoners got by the Anzacs on the night we got over was very bored with life. Apparently he had not heard of the Jutland fight and didn't wish to know anything about it and was frankly tired of the whole thing. There was quite a good scene after our little raid about 5.30 a. m with me and the Brigade Major and 2 of our officers in a dug out with a prisoner sitting in a bed drinking a whiskey and soda and eating a biscuit, while we were pumping him for all we were worth with the aid of an interpreter, a private in the regiment who I suspect as being a Hun, but is quite a good chap. This is quite illegal as all prisoners have to be set back at once to be pumped by the staff behind. However they never tell us all we want to know so we have to find out for ourselves. Please thank Father for his list of office heroes! - and put it away somewhere for me, for which purpose I return it -- with a few more Bosch coins for the family in general -- all off a prisoner. I took some out of his purse and put in some French money instead, as it will be so much more useful to him and they haven't got buttons enough to go round. Thank everyone for their recent books of which I have a collection unread at the moment as I haven't had any time. However I shall be able to get on with them now. Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-02,Unknown
"My dear Mother, I never thanked you for your cake which arrived quite safely and looked very good, as alas in transit it found its way to one of the Company messes who devoured it and I got theirs instead and I am sure mine was the better. I return Cecily's photograph, but don't see much value in it, as it might just as well represent anyone else. I have just heard that the big push has begun and that the first day's plans to advance 1000 yards on a 20 mile front were carried out. I wonder if it's true as if so, we shall have peace on us before we can prevent it. I have been writing reports on our raid since the day it came off and am by this time fairly sick of it, though I am still cheered by its success. I don't know that there is much more I can tell you in a letter about it. Lane Nichols had an amusing time in a dug out with 5 Bosches only one of whom resisted and he got shot. 3 of the others he pulled out individually and made prisoners by dint of ramming his revolver into their ribs. One last he pulled out from under a bed by his hair. They were Prussians but had not much go in them. though Ian Underhills Battn. had a similar show on at the same time and they found the Bosch sitting up and taking notice - and didn't do much good in consequence. I enclose the gassed button as promised and will try to include a tassel worn by a Bosch N. C. O. as a sword knot if the envelope will take it. also a coin, which you will notice is new and made of some very poor metal. Reynolds another of our officers was slightly wounded and 2 men fairly seriously and 4 very slightly, so we came off well. I had a very advantageous position to see it from in the front line and was quite comfortable, till someone dropped in a Bosch prisoner on top of me. He contrived to fall in sideways and still keep his hands up murmuring Kameral - rather a feat. So we incarcerated him and then one of those fools of R. E. ^ who had gone over with 20 lbs of explosives to blow up anything of interest in the enemy trench came back without using it and started the bomb off accidentally in our trench just behind me. He then said run and cleared off and I covered, as I heard the thing foozling and thought it was a Minnie that had come off. Actually we had to wait 3 minutes for it to go off, as it had a 3 minute fuse and if the ass had only kept his head, we could have dealt with it, but no one knew what it was. It made an unholy mess of our trench and we had to dig one of our officers out of a dug-out where he was surrounded by timbers and ammunition boxes and bombs etc with only his head sticking out. No one was injured except the R. E. who I'm glad to say has got shell shock. Love to all Jack We move to-day a mile up the road to L____. ",1916-07-01,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from yourself, G C and Odd. Also for a box of cigars from Father. I fear I have not written for several days as we have recently moved (I think I told you that) and Peter Bye has been ill, so I had to do adjutant, but he has now recovered. I was on a Court Martial all this morning deciding with some very mild malefactors. Of course everyone is very interested in the war, but we don't get much more news than you do from the papers. I gather that the old Bosch was prepared for us in the northerly part but not in the south where we and the French have advanced further and I hear to-day that the French are right through and having pushed their cavalry through and found nothing, are putting their infantry through as well. 2ndly that a whole Batln. of Prussians surrendered to us en bloc and 3rd that 2 Saxons have come over somewhere and said that if we can arrange it they will all come, as they are sick of the whole thing. I have heard similar tidings before. If all this is true, things must be going simply A1. I think the idea was to catch the Bosch napping all along the line, and they thought they had, but they appear to have been incorrect. It looks to me as if he will have to retire, so I hope we shall be pushing after him very shortly. Of course he may have more men in spare, but I don't know where he is going to get them, as they can't spare any on the East and the Verdun lot won't be much use for a 2nd show elsewhere. Please let me know if you get the button and coins, as I still have a Bosch bayonet and N. C. O.'s Tassel to get rid of. I was in our metropolis 2 afternoons ago buying things and had my horse taken, luckily it was returned by the idiot who took it before I had started to walk back and I hope he got startled as my animal wants some knowing and the fool took him in mistake for a mild old beast which it would insult any horse much less mine to be accused of resembling. I hear one of the Guards Battalions made a big raid the other day with the whole battalion and when they got into the enemy trench they found two miserable Huns -- whom they presumably captured. It is very wet and likely to continue so Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-05,Mother
"My dear Odd, Many thanks for your letter to-day. Contrary to your suppositions I am very comfortably ensconced in camp behind the firing line, and though the men have plenty of work to do, I am comparatively free. I suppose we shall be going up to the line again shortly, in about a week I should guess. We are all very excited about the show down south and wonder whether the old Bosch will have to retire all along the line, so you can imagine me chasing him across Belgium, if he does. I hope he doesn't - anyhow just yet, as I don't want to move in the least -- besides it will be so very uncomfortable. I have just written a long letter home which I daresay you will see in time. I am very glad to hear the pram is her own bright little self again, and that Father has taken to driving her again. I have just got our new gramophone for the Canteen, a thing called a Primaphone, from Whiteleys costing £5.10.0 and a really good instrument. I fear however that it is from a Bankrupt's stock, so if it breaks I shan't be able to get it repaired and I am quite sure they will break it in no time. However at present it is running very well. Your tales of your bathroom are too horrible for words. It must be somewhat disconcerting to find someone else's leg on a shelf or a couple of molars in the soap dish. However I suppose you get used to these things like anything else. yrs. Jack. ",1916-07-05,Odd
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from you and g. I was interested to hear the rumours that Cavalry are ready to break through, but we heard the same last year at Loos and they will take some time yet before cavalry can do anything. The Bosch is very quiet here, so I suppose he is concentrating his efforts on the Somme, unless he is preparing something in the way of a counter attack -- but I don't fancy he has the men and I think he will find all things prepared for him. I was wandering round a farm to-day which used to be inhabited by Bairnsfather and he has done some quite good drawings on the walls. I remember seeing a picture of the room in the Bystander, which made the place a very comfortable looking spot. Circumstances however have changed and the sitting room is now full of R. E. material and the inhabitants live in the cellars, which they have taken pains to shove up, as the Hun strafes them periodically. The farm must have been a lovely place, red brick round a quadrangle with a moat round the outside and a very pretty name which I won't tell you as it gives the district away where I am and the Censor wouldn't like it. We have had two beautiful days running and from the look of the sunset we shall have another to-morrow Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-09,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter to-day, also for a cake which arrived all right in a box, but had managed to break up a bit on the way, more from internal combustion I fancy than outside pressure. Anyhow it is a very good cake, but as it got broken up, some of it gets wasted. I fancy the baker out to put a little more starch or glue in it to hold it together. Please thank Mrs. Russell for a bottle of Creme de Menthe which has also arrived and has gladdened our hearts at dinner to-night. I have also received several papers from you all. We have again moved a little distance but sufficiently far to be in new country to me, though we are out of the line at the moment and living in a cottage in a wood -- really very pleasant though subject to shell fire as we are in the neighbourhood of seve several batteries, which have been strafing all day and have made a most infernal din. we have got some deep tunnels to resort to in the event of a strafe and I shall gracefully descend thereto in a few minutes with the Battalion to beguile the midnight hours with sweet music produced by the Canteen Corporal and the new gramophone (which is a great success) what time some other people set to work and strafe the Bosch. While in the tunnel he can shell away for all he is worth, but wont affect us, unless he takes the roof off our cottage, when I shall lose most of my things, as I sleep in the attic. However he cant see the cottage, so I hope he will let it alone. I went round the back area of the bit of the line we are to hold this morning. Our headquarters are at what's left of a farm very cramped with a most indelicate address -- after the style of Dead Pig Farm only I mustn't say what it really is as the Censor will be cross. so we are going to build some new headquarters which will probably be ready about the time we leave the district I see the Bosch is complaining of the British emanations of gas, which are beyond the bounds of International Law. so evidently they have some affect on him and I gather that he is going to get a little more to-night. Love to all Jack ",1916-07-12,Mother
"My dear Glad. I am very sorry I have not been able to get back and see you before you go off but you know how things are and there is no regular leave going. Still you will only be away for a year and when you come back next time there will be no war and you won't have to dodge Moewes no the high seas or snipers in Dublin. I will drink yours two healths in the bottle of Creme de Menthe which you have sent me, if there is any left on the 19th which I rather doubt so it may have to be whiskey after all. I hear to-day that they are going ahead well down South and they seem to be making a really good gap in the Bosch lines. They say that they have done with 75,000 casualties what they expected to do with 150,000, but this is probably a mere rumour. Since writing this I have had three letters from yourself C and O. for which many thanks. I don't know why you say you have only 4 days more. but I suppose you have to get your baggage off. I have been wandering round a big wood to-day to call on another of our Battalions, who seem to be very comfortable here. It was a very jolly walk through the wood with occasional shells bursting some little distance off but otherwise quite peaceful. We have just had great news about the way things are going down south. Well good luck to you both. Love from Jack. ",1916-07-14,Glad
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from Mother Cecily and yourself, also for a book from Odd this morning. We are still out of the line but will be going up again shortly. I calculate that I haven't slept up in the line more than 3 nights since about the 3rd. June which is rather extraordinary, as the Brigade has been in practically the whole time since. I have no particular news. We are in a place which is surrounded by guns, which seem to be pooping off all day and night and there are rumours and in fact more direct signs that they are going to put a 12"" inch howitzer or something of the kind in our back-garden and I know that if they do this house will fall down, as it trembles now when a limber goes by. I gather that Jack Bourchiers home has been badly strafed lately, so they are turning everyone out, which should do some of these A. S. C. people a lot of good. They are all so jolly comfortable that a little unexpected movement is all to their advantage. Besides it will give a certain basis of truth to the stories they tell at home. I was staying in the place myself once when they burst a shell in the street just up the road, as somehow one doesn't expect the things in an occupied town. I hear rumours that leave may be opening up again soon, but whether there is anything in it I can't say. I also hear on very good authority that the Bosch Casualties down South are very heavy, which is satisfactory considering that our own are considered to be lighter than they expected. The Bosch appears to be making a good fight for it at present. I was sorry that you failed to get to Aldenham. I new the front tyres were bad, but thought there was still a little life in them. I wonder if he has got the front wheels true, as nothing wears out tyres more than being on a wheel which is not running quite in the straight. I think I sent you my license and I now enclose the Receipt for my insurance Premium which please keep for me. Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-16,Father
"My dear Father, I do not know if I have any letters to acknowledge as the post yesterday only brought official correspondence except a magazine from Odd, for which many thanks. We are out of the line ^ trenches again and the men are getting a little rest without working parties, which will do them no harm. I do not know that there is anything I can talk about as one is supposed not to say anything about military matters and when you come to think of it there is nothing else to talk about, even the state of the weather on our side of the trenches might be of immense importance to the Bosch, or again it might not. I see they courtmartialled an officer the other day for using a code with marked letters. He must have been rather a simple minded youth not to be able to defeat the censor. I have heard of people who have managed it, but perhaps they are more intelligent now. I was rather surprised that they let through that thing I sent you the other day. To-morrow being Sunday I am told though no one out here ever seems to know what day of the week it is, I suppose I must fix up a service. Last week we had a Non Conformist who is far better than our C of E fellow, though the latter does his best. The former is a Cornishman from St. Austell and quite a good chap. he got mentioned in despatches last time and the others are consequently distinctly jealous Last week's service was held round an emplacement they were digging for a big gun. We cleared away luckily before the gun fired, as I was quite convinced that our abode which was under 100 yards away would collapse when they fired the engine but I hear that it has survived though I expect it rocked considerably. Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-22,Father
"My dear Cecily, My very best and heartiest congratulations on the certificate. I expect it is a bit hard to realise after 3 years work that you won't have to be continually grinding away at the R. A. M. but it will gradually dawn on you and I expect you will appreciate a holiday. I am most awfully glad that you have got it. I have had letters from Glad and Willie to-day written in the train on their way to Liverpool. I sent them a wire to the Mendi, which I hope reached them in time. The drink has not yet arrived but is probably on the way. We are still in a farm and a whole one ^ at that which is rather a change from one I was in a short time ago. It went by the name of Stinking Farm and it was really extraordinary how any of it was still standing, as it had been badly strafed. It had only been built in 1914, so I suppose it stood the shells better than most. As a matter of fact, the stink has long since passed away, but it was full of mosquitoes and most uncomfortable, so I was glad to get out of it. On the last night we managed to set the dug-out on fire, so the Bosch probably noted the fact and shelled the place the next morning, but of course we had gone by then. I hear that some of our aeroplanes down south are flying as low as 600 ft. over the Bosch lines and counting the numbers of Bosches in their trenches which must be an extraordinary useful bit of information for us and exceedingly distasteful to the Hun. Normally they fly over at about 8000 ft and get pretty badly strafed then, so what it is like at 600 I can't imagine. Perhaps at that height the Bosch archies can't get at them properly. I am enclosing a present for yourself and am sending Odd one too, an un-birthday present. Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-23,Cecily
"My dear Mother, Thanks for letters from you, Cecily and Odd -- also for various papers. I have been pretty busy lately with Peter Bye's work, so have had no time to write, but he should be back to-night. We are still out of the line and getting a little chance to train the men, which is all to the good, as up to now whenever they were supposed to be resting they usually had to go out on working parties for one reason or another. We are basking in most glorious weather which looks likely to continue. Everyone seems very satisfied with the way the Somme battle is going and they seem prepared to go on with it as long as the Bosch likes. I don't know that I have any news and one cant talk-shop or I shall be putting my foot in it with the Censorship Regulations. I have just had to do some billeting and had rather a difficult job as the villagers are not in the best of tempers, having I fancy been badly treated of previous occupiers. However there was one empty home I wanted which the owner, a lady with a red and watery eye, wouldn't give up under any circs. though I attempted every blandishment. However by dint of seeing the Maire's secretary (who is the local schoolmaster) in his school and with several interviews with the lady and the garde champ etre who is an agile old thing, about 94 years old, and after being nearly deafened by a conversation between the landlady and himself in which all parties lost their wool in the first half minute and failed to find it till discussion ceased ¾ hour later -- chiefly from want of breath -- I got the landlady's daughter out with the Key and of course once in the house we didn't leave it and are there still. The landlady's daughter wept bitterly and it was a harrowing scene altogether -- I daren't go near the landlady's house or I shall meet with the same treatment as the garde champetre. I hope you are getting plenty of juice for the pram, though I fear from what I see in the papers that you won't get much. I don't see much leave going, just now with this Somme business on. I am sorry C. cannot get to Havre, still Invergordon ought to be a good substitute. Still I should have thought they might have done something for her in town with the Certificate to wave in their faces. I am glad to hear G. and W. liked the gramophone. W. wrote and said he has found a new sort which was particularly good, when it was really the kind I mentioned about 3 months ago. I can find nothing more to say Love to all Jack.

"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter and for one from Mother both received to-day. It is certainly curious how the sound of the guns varies as on some days they are as distinct as possible and on others one can hear nothing though the wind is the same. I am positive I heard the Verdun guns when we were at Hooge but everyone said I was a liar. However it is no further than from you to Albert. It may depend on the sensitiveness of ones ears. I see that another of our Battalions has been in the thick of it, from to-day's Casualty List and I suppose our turn will come in time. As far as I can gather many regiments ^ battalions have been through, with extraordinarily few casualties -- one Division got into the Bosch front line with only 3 - and others have been more or less badly knocked. I suppose it depends on the variety of Bosch opposite. We are still out of the line and have had the men out on parade. They need a little drill as Trench life is not ideal from a discipline point of view. The weather is gorgeous and altogether we are having a very pleasant time. I am sorry to hear that there are a lot of Carshalton Casualties. I saw that they had got young Madder. I ran into a Mill Lane Man in Well Walk the other day, Well Walk being a trench we both have frequented from time to time. I didn't know him and I don't know his name now, but we had a short chat. Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-28,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for a couple of Magazines and for various letters which are no doubt coming when the post arrives. Another beautiful day and we are keeping the sawbath with a little church in an orchard and lots of sleep. I have no news. the Somme show is going all right and we saw the C. O. of one of the Battalions who has been in it and his description was very interesting. Apparently they are now running motor lories across what was No Mans Land and they had roads built right across directly the advance was made. The Bosch tramways behind are very useful and save us a lot of trouble in getting things up, though I suppose it takes time to get them in to working order. We have just received a great compliment from the G. O. C. of a regular division who was motoring through yesterday and expressed his great surprise to our own Divisional bloke that ours is a service Battalion, and certainly compared with the appearance of many of them our chaps don't look bad. There is no more news. Love to all Jack. ",1916-07-30,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for a box of excellent cigars, and also a letter from Odd and another and a postcard from Mother. I was greatly interested in the group though I have failed to identify several of the portraits. I am glad you have managed to get a little juice for the pram. I'm afraid 6 gallons a month won't carry you far, but please don't save any up, as Lord only knows when there will be any more leave as things seem to be quite active still and one never knows when they won't start a strafe somewhere or other. The weather is still very hot and sunny and but the wind has got up to-day, so it is rather more comfortable than it was. Please tell Mother that my Trench boots should be all right and I shall probably need them again this winter -- but we must wait and see. I have had letters from C and O. also a book The Weavers which arrived just as I had finished the last one, the Red House which I never acknowledged. At the moment we have no mess, so we feed under a tarpaulin stretched on posts with the table laid on the ground and a couple of trenches cut in each side to put your legs in -- quite a good idea. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-04,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from you and Cecily. I am sorry the pram has broken down again but hope that Wardill and his minions if he has any will be able to mend it, as I don't suppose the makers will be able to do anything or that you will be able to get a new axle these times. The fine weather continues and one can hardly realise that it ever rains here. However at the back of one's mind are faint recollections of a little mud last November and the days when we used to walk about outside the trenches in full view of the bosch, because you would drown if you got into them. I am glad to hear G. has got as far as Dakar or whatever the place is all right, as she should be out of the region of submarines anyhow. I have just heard form Alicia Aldons that was from India. No news. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-09,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from you and Mother and Cecily and for a cake and other eatables from the family. The weather continues though it rained a bit yesterday which was a pleasant relief rather than otherwise. I can tell you nothing of where we are and what we are doing. I gather that George is in the country and I suppose will be disporting himself on the territory which was lately Germany which ought to annoy Wilhelm somewhat. I am in the trenches again and am at the moment being violently strafed by the Bosch, who is not putting many over but is putting them all round here. The whole place is covered with dust at the moment, as the last one burst just outside the door, luckily with no damage to anyone except a shock to my servant. He might have bagged the G. O. C. and C. O.'s in here if he had only but the top of the dug-out, but he didn't and has now ceased which is just as well. The posts have been hopelessly irregular lately and there have been no newspapers for 3 days. I wonder if you would order at Wisden's next door to Leicester Square Tube Station 1 dozen footballs to be packed so as to come out by parcel post. I want their best quality, which cost about 12 /-, if they are for the troops and if you would pay for them I will send a cheque for the amount. Love to all Jack ",1916-08-11,Father
"Dear Father, I enclose a letter which ought to have been sent off yesterday. I have several to acknowledge from Mother and Cecily and some magazines and a cake and shortbread.

R. people are reasonable and that we shall get a little more. Would you get a little War Loan or War Certificates with mine and send them when obtained to my bank. I was very interested to hear about Burridge and also got the circular about Solicitors in the Forces. I think it would be all right out here, as men want to know things occasionally, but I can't see myself loitering around the entrance to the Y. M. C. A. with a K and E. in either hand. I had a letter from Gery Clayton yesterday. His young woman is quite a new one and found at Eastbourne where I remember meeting her last year, but I have forgotten all about her. I fancy Jo Brookes is still at Oswestry but I gather that he may be coming out soon, though no one can guarantee that he will come back here. The last of the 4 who came with Charlie was wounded last night, I am afraid rather seriously, but they can't say for certain yet. We have been up in the line for a few days but are out again for the moment. The Hun is very active with his artillery and gave us a regular doing 2 nights ago more or less all night. Owing however to a lot of luck and the narrowness of our trenches we had one man slightly wounded and several who thought they had shell shock chiefly because they had been buried and had to be dug out. However our artillery is equally active and the net result is that no one fires any rifles and when there is no shelling the nights are absolutely silent. At the moment we are near some guns which I suppose have been annoying the Bosch as he is chucking back some enormous stuff and a great lump has just come back about 300 yds and hit our cook house and nearly destroyed the dinner. The lump weighs about 25 lbs and is evidently a part of a big shell. the gunners say it is an 8 inch armour piercing shell and it seems rather poor spirited to play on us with stuff like that when the ordinary whizz bang is quite sufficient. However they are going to town in a 9.2 to even things up, destroy Fritz's dinner in return. We don't lose our soup for nothing. I had a letter from Miss Waldie myself she is a phenomenal letter writer. I hear the French have been making more pushes in the South. I wonder how long the Bosch will stand the hammering. They say he has already used up about 17 Divisions, which means that his losses are at least equal to ours and he has lost more than 1 ½ Divisions in unwounded prisoners alone. He must be very annoyed at finding that the French are replenishing themselves with more Russians, as all his labours to do the French in is in vain. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-14,Father
"My dear Mother, Several days post has arrived in one and I have letters from you and Cecily to acknowledge also some papers. I am glad to hear you talking about a holiday as I am sure you and Father both need one and now the family is away you have got a chance. Will you take the pram or isnt it worth while. I hear that if you put in 1/5th of paraffin to 4/5th petrol it makes no difference except in smell and goes further, so it might be worth a trial. The weather is fine but the nights are getting a bit chilly. Things are fairly busy just now. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-19,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks to you for various letters and papers, a box of cigars, socks, copies of Gs letters. I have no news I can tell you. We have been in a small show and are now out of the line again with the prospect of a little rest, which we've not had lately. I got hit by a bit of a shell the other day on my right forearm, but it only bruised my arm and I didn't notice it 5 minutes afterwards. However I may appear in the list as a wounded hero, so don't worry if you see my name. I don't know why they are going to put it in but it looks well. I am writing to the bank to send Father a cheque for the footballs, which have not yet arrived, but will probably come to-day or to-morrow. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-23,Mother
"My dear Odd, Many thanks for your letter to-day. I went to Shillingford in the pram just over a year ago and should very much like to see it again as it seemed an ideal spot with an excellent pub, but perhaps you did not patronize it. It was the home of the Asquith family I think (the place not the pub) and I saw the redoubtable Master Antony A. careering round the place. An interval as the battalion has just arrived and I must arrange for its disposal. It doesn't do to leave beer about the place or it would go very quickly, and quite without your noticing it. We have had some football for the men this afternoon and now there is an open air concert going on with a 9.2 pooping off just behind. How anyone can hear anything beats me but they all seem to be enjoying themselves. I should think the Hun will come over soon and drop a bomb to cheer them up a bit more. Why do you refer to Constance in so bored a way. You should enjoy your cousin more. I am sure she takes a very great interest in all your doings. There is no news -- the usual strafe continues though we are now behind it instead of in it which makes a lot of difference. Love from Jack. ",1916-08-25,Odd
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from you Father and Cecily and few copies of letters from G. which by the way I think I have acknowledged before. As usual there is no news except that we are not actually in the line at the moment. I have just been reading Wednesday's paper, which makes things out to be very hopeful. We seem to be gaining quite a lot as a whole and I should think it ought to increase. I heard last night that the French had advanced 1500 yds. in places which is some gain in these times. At the moment we are in camp in a cornfield -- though there is very little camp about it as the men are mostly sleeping under their waterproof sheets. I have managed to get some beer for them which is extraordinarily popular. Please thank Odd for her last letter Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-26,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for paying the car premium for which I enclose my cheque. Also thanks to Mother and Cecily for letters. When and where are you going for your holiday? C. says you won't take the pram and I suppose she wouldn't be much good as there is not enough juice to do any runs, when you have got there, besides I suppose you would have to carry it with you, though I don't know how the ticket system works. We are in billets in a village at the moment, crowded but dry which is a great blessing as the weather is inclined to be wet and our last place was a camp on the hillside with only 8 tents for the Battalion, so the men got rather wet. I pity those poor devils up in the trenches on the Somme as of course they cannot revet them and all the trenches will be falling in and give no protection and the communication trenches will probably be impassable. However it will be the same for the Bosch only rather more so. I see they have been Zepping you lately, but I hope it was not near home and that they didn't call you out every night for no reason. It is extraordinary what little damage they do for all the efforts they make. I suppose we shall bag one or two of them soon, which should make them think twice about coming over again. I might even go so far as to retaliate on Cologne or some such place. In this particular place when we got in last night, we found it full of thousands of flies, which are nothing like so bad this year as a rule. However by blowing a tin of Keatings in the air when we went to bed, we have killed practically the lot and the air is now practically free. This is quite a good tip and extraordinarily successful. We have just got a wire that Roumania has come in against Austria, which is rather cheering and ought to prove the last straw. Incidentally I have just been reading extracts from German Prisoners Diaries which show that they are having the very deuce of a time from our artillery and that they don't like it at all. I wonder how they will appreciate the remainder of our guns when they arrive by next year. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-27,Father
"My dear Cecily, Very many thanks for various letters and papers. I am very sorry not to have written so frequently as usual, but these times make it occasionally rather difficult to get a letter off, and still more difficult to get anything to say. I have already written home to-day and given them all the news there is. We are well behind the line at the moment in billets and a very comfortable bed for yours truly which is the first I have slept in for aeons -- since the middle of June I guess and that was a very uncomfortable one. I went out for a ride this afternoon with the C. O. between the showers but we didn't get far owing to the weather and the crops and dozens of trenches which have been dug from time to time in case the Hun breaks through and one comes across them most unexpectedly in the long grass with any amount of barbed wire, also effectively hidden. We also came across some gangs of Bosches -- prisoners, whom they are now using on our roads -- guarded by diminutive youths who have enlisted but are under age and have been claimed by their parents. So they are put on this kind of job, not that the Bosch would dream of escaping, as he is quite comfortable and as far as I can gather extremely glad to be out of it all. We have had the news to-day that Roumania has come in, which everyone considers as the beginning of the end. Whatever else happens it ought to make the Bosch sit up and think a bit. Love to my cousins. Yrs Jack. B. E. F. ",1916-08-28,Cecily
"My dear Father, Nothing to acknowledge to-day, except a letter from Glad. for which I have written to her. There is no news. I am at the moment back in the transport line with the migraines, what time the Battalion is up in the front line. The disease is very prevalent at the moment and I got a bad dose early yesterday morning just as we started on trek to come up and as I didn't get better I stayed back last night. However I fancy I shall go up to-morrow and I don't think I have missed anything as they are only sitting in trenches dodging whizz bangs. The weather the last two days has been too filthy for words and the trenches must be indescribable. I have seen some men who have been in them the last few days and I never saw such disgusting looking objects. However it is fine now, so perhaps they will dry up a bit by the time I get up there to-morrow. To-day is the anniversary of my arrival in France last year -- an interesting year but I don't know that I am keen on repeating it and I daresay it won't be necessary to do so. They say now that the difficulty [now] is not to get shells to fire, but to fire off the amount of shells they give them, which looks well for the future when we get more guns going. Love to all Jack. ",1916-08-31,Father
"My dear Mother, many thanks for letters from you and C. By this time you ought to have got my letter explaining my being wounded or rather bruised for it was nothing more and it was ridiculous my name going in at all. If I had thought I would have stopped it, but when it was sent in I was sleeping the sleep of the just, as we had been having a roughish time and no sleep. As you say you know I am in the big push I can't contradict you and am at the moment sitting in a deep Bosch dug-out which was built for a worthy Hun and is now used by the unworthy British. And it is a great safeguard as of course he knows of the place and constantly strafes it and last night blew in the entrance only owing to the Bosch's foresight he had cut a passage into another dug out and we could get aid through that if we had needed it, though we dug ourselves out with no difficulty. We are holding trenches in a fairly well known spot and it is certainly distinctly lively. There are lots of Bosches about, as they came in in the mornings in little groups having surrendered on the night before. I think he is losing or has lost most of his string, as his counterattacks appear to be very half hearted affairs. I was sorry to see that Tom Underhill has been killed I must stop to catch the post. Love to all Jack. ",1916-09-02,Mother
"My dear Family, I have lots of letters to thank you all for, in fact from the whole billing including little G. from the far Equator, also various papers and photographs, which I was very glad to get. I was accosted to-day in the march by one Tucker who seems to live in High St. and be one of Fathers pals though I don't know him myself. Anyhow we had a short and sweet discourse about the old homeland and were interrupted by a heated Traffic Control officer who was most indignant with the Battalion Transport for shipping up his road, and did not meet again as I had to go and see to it. I was at the moment examining some guns, which had been taken earlier in the show from the Bosch. there were about a dozen of them, all from Liege or Russian, which I suppose the Bosch had captured earlier on. They are all badly smashed up, evidently by the Hun himself, so they are now lying in a by road behind. We have our backs to the enemy at the moment and are out of the line for a bit. The Rt. Hon. Erbert Enery Asquith was mucking about this morning and has by this time probably blown himself up with a bomb or been blown up by a shell -- this is no place for globe trotters. Everyone is much pleased with Cecily's poem which had not penetrated to our far off clime. I am quite sure it is not sung in the trenches as I have never heard anyone sing anything there, though someone did come across a fellow playing a mouth organ to himself in a shell hole where he had been for some hours waiting for help as he couldn't get out himself. Our Doctor has a story of an Irish soldier he tied up, who was very tired of things. He had gone in to a show determined to bag a Bosch, which he did and was bringing him back when somebody else who didn't like Bosches, abolished him, so he had to go back and get another and then when on his way back with the second, he got hit himself and someone else took off with his Bosch again. He appears to be quite convinced that he would have been allowed to take him back to Ireland. ",1916-09-06,Family
"My dear Mother, I am sorry not to have been able to write for a few days, but what with being up in the line and coming back for a few days I have had no opportunity. I started a letter several days ago but have not finished it and do not at the moment know where it is. However you shall have it if it turns up. At the moment I am in a farm which we got to late last night after a somewhat tedious journey and with any luck we shall be out of the line for a few days anyhow and possibly quite an accountable period, but no one will promise any definite time. I have had no post for 2 or 3 days and haven't even seen the papers about the Zepp raid, though of course I have heard that there has been another big one, but that no damage was done -- which must be rather euphemistic, I should fancy. Anyhow there are apparently one or two Zepps less now than there were. This is quite a pleasant village and very refreshing after the district we have left and I can see some fat ducks in the yard and there are butter and eggs and milk about which we have not had except tinned for some time, so I fancy we shall do ourselves pretty well. Love to all Jack. I am sending this to 17 Alb St. as I don't know where you are. I enclose the other letter I began. ",1916-09-08,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for a book from Hatchards and a box of cigars. -- no letters have come lately however and I think the posts must be all wrong. Will you please let me know that you have got my cheque for the car insurance and the 7. 13. 8 for the footballs, which arrived all right and are very useful now. We are still out of the line and the men are getting a good rest. We sent off a party of them this morning to the seaside for a couple of nights, which they ought to enjoy, but I doubt if we shall have time to work through the whole lot, and there is some talk of some of the officers getting a few hours in one of the bigger towns in rear with the chance of a bath and a recherché meal, so if you get a P. C. from me from some such place you will know why I'm there. Church in an orchard this morning and a particularly dull padré. I hope you are having a decent holiday with good weather. Love to all Jack. I have still no address to write to you at. ",1916-09-10,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for various letters to-day dated between the 1st and 6th all of which arrived together. Also for some Owen Seaman Verses from Father. I am sorry you have had so many letters of enquiries to answer as to my arm -- it makes me feel even more of a fraud than before. We are still back in billets with nothing much to do. I went in to the local metropolis yesterday for a meal and to get a few things, but as it was he sawbath I was not very successful. Odd seems to be full of news of the Zeppelin, as of course she is in the thick of it and seems to have a piece as a keepsake. She also seems to have seen it on fire, which must have been a very cheering sight. My migraines are better but not right yet, however I daresay after a little repose my inside will recover itself. It is very fine the way they are getting on against the Bosch. and this in spite of the Kaiser and Hindenburg in person shooing on the Hun. What they will be like when these lights are turned off Lord only knows. I hope you find a good spot for your holiday and have decent weather Love from Jack. My dear Family, Thanks for letters and cards from Llandudno and some scotch shortbread and letters from Invergordon. There is no news. The weather is wet and there is nothing doing, as we are still in billets. I have just got to ride over to the Brigade Office about something or other and am already late so au revoir. Jack. ",1916-09-11,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters of the 7th and 10th received to-day and for a letter from Cecily of the 8th and Odd of the 6th, also a cake (and some shortbread yesterday ^ from C) from Odd and a letter from Lillie which I return. I have had a full day with complicated Court Martials and go on to-morrow I am also in temporary charge, as the C. O. has been suddenly called home as his wife is apparently very ill. I hope it is not really serious but it is very sudden. She was all right a few days ago, as she was working on the land down Gomshall way. She is a daughter of Leader the artist. I was just about to get a couple of days leave too, which of course is now off, as I shall have to stay here and cope with the great and glittering as they swarm about here and need to be firmly tackled. But whispers have reached me of the dim and distant possibility of leave to England being reopened, so it is possible that by the end of the month I shall be looking you up wherever you may be. However I haven't got leave yet and nor has anyone else to my knowledge except the C. O. whose leave is of the special variety, and of course they may push us into the line again especially if there is a big push on and it is successful and I see that the D. T. says there is a big push coming off. However all this is as may be Anyhow you had better make no arrangements and don't let Cecily come South or do anything foolish like that on the chance, as it is all so very remote. I am quite sure the Censor wouldn't like me to say where I was on the 21st ult so I fear it must keep. I was shown round part of a Chateau to-day, where we were holding our Court -- a Count by the owner, a Count with a penchant for collecting things and he has a fine lot of furniture and carving. A lovely old place which has been in the family 600 years. What are your plans for the end of the month? Love to all Jack If it is fine what about Oxford for a few days, if I get off? I could get the pram there. ",1916-09-14,Father
"My dear Mother, Thanks for yours and for one from Cecily to-day. I am glad you like the place. I fear the prospects of leave are not so rosy to-day as I can't help thinking we shall move out of this garden of Eden before my turn arrives and I don't know where we shall be going to. They are pushing ahead up on the Somme and I don't know whether they will want us back or not and if so, when and of course the more they push -- the more they are likely to want troops. However we have had a very good time here and the rest has done the men a lot of good. To-day we were playing a lot of football -- six aside -- which amuses them. To-morrow I shall give them a day off, though as a matter of fact they have done very little work at all here though the staff insists on their doing any amount and so they do -- on paper, but we have the sense not to carry it out. My migraines are much better and I now sympathize with others who have the complaint and there is still some of it about. I fancy we caught it off the Bosch, as it was quite unheard of till we began to live in his dug-outs. I have just spent a happy hour in concocting a gentle reply to one of the Division who has shewn himself an ass and has delivered himself into my hands. However I fear he is too thick-headed to realise the depth of my sarcasm. I did it once before long long ago and they had to invoke the aid of the G. O. C. to get level, but this time I am much subtler. Love to all Jack. ",1916-09-16,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from all members of the family since I last wrote. Owing to an alteration in billets and the odds and ends therely entailed I have had no chance of writing for the last 2 days. We seem to have exchanged one quite pleasant village for another, though owing to the weather we got very wet in the process. I am expecting a few more nights in a very comfortable bed and then we shall probably go up nearer the line. We had great trouble with one of our horses last night, who developed a bad go of colic and had to be sat up with and dosed all night. Luckily he is all right this morning though looking very sorry for himself and I don't blame him, judging from all the stuff he swallowed. Our doctor is on leave, so we have a substitute from the ambulance -- quite a genial little thing from Western Canada, but his manners require a little polish and he is rather given to spitting. However he will not be ours for long. I hear the tanks they are using on the Somme were quite a success, though 2 or 3 are now prisoners in the Bosche's hands and one or two are deranged by being hit by crumps. I gather that none of the crews had been out before, which must have been rather a handicap, as it is not easy to spot machine guns and such like till you know more or less where to look for them, so I suppose that next time they are used, they will do better still. They appear to be quite convinced that by the middle of next month the Bosch will be really hard put to it for men and it is quite clear that he is losing as many ^ a very large number of men daily behind the lines from our continuous artillery fire, so whether this weather goes on or not they will keep the guns on him all the time and if he persists in holding out, he will have the same thing along the whole front for the whole of next summer and I don't envy him the prospect. I know no more about leave only I don't see why I shouldn't get some fairly soon, say early next month, but I can't say anything for certain. Love to all Jack. ",1916-09-20,Father
"My dear Mother, I have another letter from Cecily to acknowledge, also ones from G and W. Another very peaceful day from our point of view, though we have been strafing all day with every sort of trench engine. I was awoke at 4.45 this morning by Master Brooks with the horrible news that the Bosch was in our lines, or rather in a crater outside which we hold, so I hastened up expecting to find the trench full of Bosches. However by the time I got up, I found that he had been ejected -- however he had taken 2 of our lambs with him as souvenirs, and these I think were all he came for, as he didn't make any attempt to hold the place. We bagged and brought in one of his officers and are certain of getting one of his party and possibly more, so I don't know that he got much the best of it, though I regret the loss of our 2 lambs. There are a lot of these kind of shows up and down the line now, mostly on our part and I daresay we shall have to do another before long. I was very glad we got the officer, as he was a very good card to play when the G. O. C. came round, as if we had got nothing he might have been a bit nasty but as it was, butter wouldn't have melted in his mouth The staff get quite indignant if our posts get rushed and equally so, if we don't rush the Bosch's when required -- however I suppose they are paid to be so. We go back to the support line to-morrow which is stuck away in an arid waste miles from the nearest village and quite untroubled by the Bosch. So I don't know what we shall do with ourselves though there will be no difficulty in finding work for the men. I enclose a drawing which may convey something to someone. I have not seen the subject but had it described more or less accurately and am not giving away secrets as the Bosch has seen it. Love to all Jack ",1916-10-09,Mother
"My dear Father, Thanks for your letter as to Peareth money, also to Mother C and O. for letters, (C for 3) and a book. I see they mentioned in the G. H. Q. intelligence yesterday that we were raided and inflicted heavy casualties on the Bosch -- a bit of indiluted imagination as so far as we know there were only 2, though it is probable that there were a few more. The Bosch's aeroplanes are getting active here and we brought down 2 yesterday -- unfortunately I missed the fun. We are out of the trenches and in dugouts all among the guns about 2500 yds. from the line - and a quieter spot you couldn't wish to find as none of them dare fire a round except in cases of emergency as there seems to be a tacit agreement that this place is to be kept quiet except for trench mortars and such like engines. There are a number of raids taking place up and down the front and most of them seem successful though the Bosch must be very much on the look-out. When they are on, it is almost pathetic to see the small amount of shells he sends over, not at all the kind of thing we are used to. The country here has been badly strafed at one time or another and I fancy the French must have made an advance here, as we have a long way to go to get back to civilisation and our present abode might be very well in the middle of Mitcham Common with extended to the horizon and no roads. The men are let off a lot of the carrying they have to do in other places as we have a tram road which does it for them almost up to the front line. I wonder we don't use them more, as they are extraordinarily useful and save endless labour, but even when we've got them we don't use them very much. They run this one with petrol engines up to a point and then mules. I take it that you will put in for the next months supply of juice for the pram when the time comes and I rather fancy that applications have to go in now. 16 gallons a month is far more than you would get through on her. The San Esquilache people are writing again for more subscriptions. Do you know at all what Uncle Jos thinks of the concern now? I notice that all praise of the concern is greatly moderated, but yet it conveys to me the idea that they really think there's a lot in it ^ but don't like to say so, because they can't say for certain. I wonder if you would send him a line. I would do it myself but I don't know (a) how to spell his name and (b) his address. Love to all Jack. ",1916-10-12,Father
"My dear Family, I don't think I have any letters to acknowledge for 2 days, but lots of papers and letters for which many thanks. Also one or two books which are very welcome, as there is absolutely nothing for one to do all day, the men being all out on working parties and there is nowhere to walk to except wander about in the surrounding desert. We are just on the boundary of the original French and German lines and it is interesting comparing them as they were 18 months ago to what they would be now. It is quite evident that there was nothing like the shell fire then that there is now and trench mortars must have been more or less non existent, whereas now they are what the commonest form of explosive in the trenches. We have had a lot of trouble with our fire place in the mess, as the smoke is so awful that you can't live in the place (it is not unlike a potting shed with no windows) while the fires are burning, but we have now devised a method of getting 50% of smoke up the chimney which is all to the good, and we can manage to swallow the rest. Love to all Jack. ",1916-10-13,Family
"My dear Mother, Alas, our mails have gone astray, they say to the 6th Battn. So we shan't see them for some time. However I have had a letter from you and another from C. two days ago and was interested to hear that Rosamond is engaged and still more that her two brothers are going to Mesopotamia I expect they are sending all the latest joined to such delectable spots and after all it is their own fault. I am still running the shop as the C. O. has been sent for again for his wife -- she was quite all right 2 days ago he told me and I suppose she has had a relapse owing to her brother's death. Yesterday I went for a bus ride to look over the trenches which we go into next and find them to be on the exact spot where we were on the 26th Sept. 1915 and in a beastly condition too, as there had been heavy rain and they are falling in all over the place. However the place seemed very quiet, which is always comforting and we shall probably go up in a day or two. It was very cold and I had to start at 6.0 a.m. so I wasn't best pleased ^ at having to go. To-day we did a little training in the morning and a football match in the afternoon which we won rather to my surprise, as the other side were a battn. who go in for it a lot and preserve some of their best players in their transport lines. To-morrow I suppose we shall go to church in the Cinema and I shall turn on our tame and attached C. O. to inspect the Battn. as the poor chap has nothing to do and is bored stiff. Love to all Jack.

"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter enclosing a copy of Uncle Jo's -- also thanks for various books and letters from Mother and Cecily. I am glad the pram is about again and hope she will soon recover her normal composure. A filthy day in which we have walked some 9 miles in the mud and I am at the moment in a kind of greenhouse, which has no stove and hardly keeps the rain out. This is our mess, but we are going into the line to-morrow, where we shall at least have a rain- proof dug-out, and perhaps a stove which weve not got at present. A copy of Blighty has arrived, quite good -- but I don't know whether we owe it to you. I am glad to hear G. is back in her shanty again. I have heard from her to-day. I told you I think that we had a tame C. O. attached from the 3rd L. I. it appears that he was out last Novery also attached to someone else in the very bit of line we are going into. He is quite a good old thing but not above the average in competence. I shall probably have to report on him at the end of his month, as the C. O. is still away and when he comes back will probably go to the Brigade at once while the Brigadier is on leave. I fancy Sam Barrow knows very little about the tanks. A gunner told me, who had seen them and the particulars of the armament you give are greatly exaggerated so far as I can gather. Clayton was offered one but refused it, as he is still suffering from gas after effects. They tell me the Bosch tries to stop them by throwing bombs at their driving bands, but it doesn't sound very effective and I expect any weak points they have have now been spotted and will be rectified. I don't fancy the Bosch's winter on other parts of the line, if they start these things at him at unexpected points and positions. They should prove far worse than a gas attack. Love to all Jack. ",1916-10-24,Father
"My dear Mother, Thanks for your last and one from Cecily last night, also for some papers and a couple of books from Hatchards. We are in the trenches again and find them in a shocking state owing to rain. They are fairly all right and comfortable to you get up near the front line -- when they become really beastly. However if we have a little fine weather - and it seems to be clearing up -- we may be able to get them into some sort of condition. There is very little artillery but the Trench Mortars appear to be the nuisance, if allowed their own way. I went round with the General this morning together with our tame Colonel, who is inclined to be stout and visibly melted when slugging in the mud. He is not a bad old thing but rather silly and I am quite glad he is not in command here. I shall be very much put to it if I have to write a report on him when he goes. It is rather curious coming back here, as it is very difficult to recognise the ground except the general features and all the trenches seem to have altered The country round is about as attractive as the black country in England and there isn't a hill in view for miles, and the only attractions are our aeroplanes and there are not many of them. I expect this Verdun show will have an effect, as I gather that the Bosch has moved all his guns from Verdun to the Somme and now they will have to go back again, unless he takes them from the British Front, when I suppose we shall try a show somewhere else. There is a shoal of about 30 aeroplanes just going over -- on a bombing stunt I expect. Anyhow the Bosch is leaving them severely alone at the moment, though they will probably meet a few Fokkers etc further over his lines. From reports I have seen our people simply make hay of his trains and railways and never come back without derailing a train or two and blowing up an engine. They sometimes fly alongside troop. trains strafing the windows with machine guns and when the train stops they get the passengers as they are getting out. Love to all Jack. ",1916-10-26,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for 2 letters and a cake, which arrived fresh and safely. I am sending this home, as I do not know how long you are going to be at Sywell. I am very glad your Our Day show went off well -- please thank Cecily for 2 letters and Olive for one. Things seem very quiet here, beyond a few minnies and some objectionable things they call aerial darts, the Bosch does not send over much and we let him have a good deal in return. We are suffering on a/c of the slackness of the Division which was here in the summer and did absolutely nothing to the trenches, or if it did -- did it so badly that it is all falling in and the front system is in an indescribably beastly condition and the wet weather does not make things any better. I have been chiefly occupied in learning my way about and rearranging our defence which is interesting work and we have some difficult ground to look after However there have been no incidents as yet, except a small patrol encounter. The Bosch is supposed to have dogs as sentries and in one place near by a little time ago I hear they found some geese in a cage, which raised a most unholy din and the party couldn't get at them because the wire was so thick. Many thanks for the offer of a dog, but I don't think it would be of much use and would rather be in the way, especially as the authorities are not keen on them on account of rabies and all dogs are supposed to be muzzled and led on strings. The C. O. should return to-day, but goes at once to the Brigade, while the Brigadier is on leave, so I shall continue to run the show for a bit. Meanwhile our attached C. O. is showing signs of giving out and I hardly think is fit to be in the trenches. After all trench life is none too easy for the middle-aged and I don't fancy this one has been in the habit of roughing it previously. I must now cease as the Bosch is sending over some aerial darts and I must see that he gets something back in return. Love to all Jack. I enclose a note from the Stores that my watch is ready. I wonder if someone would mind getting it for me and paying the bill. I will send you some money, if you have run out of mine. ",1916-10-30,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter and for a book from Cecily. We are out of the front line, but still in dug-outs very nearly in the same place as I slept in the first time I came into this district. Our last tour passed off fairly uneventfully except that the Bosch tried a raid on us a couple of nights ago, but got driven off without loss to us and our people claim 2 of him, but I couldn't see them anywhere. However I think they must have bagged one or two, as we caught him on the hop and at very close range. The C. O. is still on leave having got an extension. so the show continues to remain in my hands -- not that I shall have much to do, as the men will all be out on working parties most of the day and in any event there will be nothing else for them to do here. We can't do Battalion drill within view and range of the Bosch. I got a book from Cecily to-day by Taffrail, which should be very good. Love to all Jack. ",1916-10-31,Father
"My dear Father, Thanks for a Bystander and a book. We are still out of the front line, but shall be going back shortly, and I expect the C. O. to return during our next tour, when I shall retire into my pristine obscurity. I must say that the job of commanding a Battalion is very interesting and I don't think I should mind the responsibility, though no doubt the brass hats would try it on a bit. However I see no chance of such an event occurring, so it is not worth consideration. Some time ago you offered me your long telescope for the use of our snipers and at the time I thought it would not be of any use. However here I think it would be and if you still would not mind the risk of losing it, I think we might find it very effective in spotting Bosches. The present case is hardly strong enough and if a better one were made for it (without any of the fixings) it ought to travel all right and I will see that it is looked after. As you know the small one was smashed up, but I consider one of the present Battalion ones, as being yours and will try to get it back for you. Someone saw a Zepp. behind the Bosch liens yesterday, but I did not see it and I hope you have not been troubled by them lately. They seem to be a little shy of London at the moment. There is no news The Battalion is for the most part on working parties and I lead an untroubled existence in consequence. Love to all Jack. ",1916-11-04,Father
"My dear Odd, Many thanks for your last. As you truly observe the weather is pretty awful -- in fact unprintable, and I watch the trenches falling in on us daily, while the cries of the smaller soldiers reecho in my ears, as I walk over them in the trenches. You see the mud is so deep that only the very tallest can hope to survive and all bantams are drowned very early on. This is quite a new one you now mention. I wonder if he is any relation to our Corps Commander, who is a fusty old gentleman, who dates his soldiering back to the late thirties, but who still manages to get round the front line. We had a whole bevy, Corps Divisional and Brigade staff all round together and they eventually decided some rotten little point, and I can't carry out their decision because I have other things for the men to do and consequently carry on as before. In fact I don't really know that they do want and I'm quite certain they don't, as they know nothing of the conditions and I've no doubt they went home and had a 7 course dinner thinking they'd done a good day's work, while we shammock about this beastly muck- heap and keep the Bosch out of their blessed cook-house. Really I do get a trifle annoyed with them at times I have moved from my last dug-out, as it was quite evident that it was planted in a cemetery and am now in quite a cosy one ""with a window."" Unfortunately the roof leaks but luckily not on to my bed, so I have somewhere to go if the worst comes to the worst. I have recently seen a mine go up -- one of ours -- I saw it a good way off. The ground seems to swell into a sort of bunion and then bursts and lots of flames come out of the middle and then someone starts a machine gun and someone else puts a little shrapnel over the place and then everyone goes to lunch. Quite simple and done in a gentlemanly fashion out of meal times, so that no ones comfort tis really disturbed Even the Bosch who is blown up, is thought of and has had his breakfast and rum ration (if he gets one) -- it would be hard times to blow him up just before this eventful moment in his day. We have just got a subaltern from the sniping school and is full of zeal and I'm so afraid he'll stir up the other people to retaliate and we shall get it hot, as they can catch us in all sorts of places. I must soothe his uncalled for ardour and insist that he sits over places where I know there aren't any Bosches and then everyone will be satisfied. I am sorry to hear of your estrangement with Knyvett Totton. Love from Jack. ",1916-11-07,Odd
"My dear Father, Thanks for yours of the 5th and for Mothers of the 3rd and Cecily's of the 4th, all arrived to-day. We have had no post for 3 days owing to the storm I suppose, and a mail was very welcome. I was interested to hear the Censor is opening my letters I wonder if I am too conversational. Let me know if he opens any more. I saw the Johnny Brongham had done it again and was interested to hear about Peggy. The C. O. arrived back to-day and I took him out to show him where our trenches used to be a few days ago. You can still see signs of them with an occasional head sticking out of the mud. Luckily the weather has temporarily changed and the water is draining off a bit. We have had a little liveliness caused by Bosch patrols on one or two nights but otherwise the Bosch trenches do not appear to be very thickly populated. We have had the most perfect moonlight nights the last 48 hours and there is another to-night -- one can see people moving 200 yards off which is a great advantage but it prevents your sending out wiring parties or patrols ^ as the Bosch can see them equally well. Many thanks for fetching my watch. The one I have is going very well and keeps good time and I should prefer to stick to it for the present, unless you want it back. Please thank Mother for the photo. she sent out. It is not one of Waldie, but a fellow of the 1st Battn. Many thanks for a Bystander and Autocar. Love to all Jack. ",1916-11-09,Father
"My dear Odd, Many thanks for yours of the 15th. I was interested to hear you have our Geoffrey with you. I am prepared to bet a good deal that there is very little wrong with him. I wonder if he calls it shell shock or is it fright or merely a constitutional inability to slick it out. and those bally balloonists live in the lap of luxury and the gunners say that most of them are positively futile, when they might be a lot of use. I think most people regard them as contemptible except the few cases of those who have been wounded before or are over age etc. I shouldn't say you are very like him in the face, as some people including himself think he is rather good looking (that should make you think a bit, my fair one). I will tell Joe when I see him. He is away at present on a course and enjoying himself hugely I understand. Anyhow he is not suffering from overwork. another quiet day, occupied in wandering round the trenches and putting a window in our mess, which only had a doorway to light us by before. I happened to come across a pane of glass so have at once had it put in and it makes all the difference. Glass is very hard to find in anything but bottle formation and a whole pane is a great luxury. Dug-outs ^ owners as a rule if they boast of windows at all never find any glass to put in them. The C. O. has again returned, so my reign is once more closed. He is now occupied in strafing the Division over some of their usual folly. I occupied a lot of time last night in writing a suitably sarcastic note but eventually decided to leave it to him and he is now carrying on the good work, so between us there ought to be something worth reading in the correspondence. Cecily's 5.gs are a great triumph and I hope there will be lots more to follow. It looks as if we owned a small Clara Butt and never appreciated the honour before. The family will yet find a home in one of her lodge gates at this rate. I was interested to hear about our Nell and suppose we have seen the last of her for some little time. I hope you pulled up with Miss Hayter when you met thus unexpectedly. I don't fancy I know the woman by sight. Love to all Jack. ",1916-11-21,Odd
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last, also for Cecily's 2 letters -- to-day's informing me of G's arrival. I am so glad she has got home safely and hope that she is none the worse. I am afraid her journey must have been very trying. Perhaps she will summon up enough energy to write me a line one of these days. There must be one or two letters of mine chasing her across the High Seas. We are out of the trenches at the moment, for a little rest which is not unwelcome to the men, as the weather has been none too good for the last few days. The Bosch is quiet and done nothing out of the ordinary for a long time, though he persisted in dropping an occasional gas shell over the other day -- all in the same place, with the result that the wind blew it over our way and we were all weeping like children for a long time afterwards. It would have been quite easy to put a gas helmet on, but no one seemed to think of it, so we bore it bravely. I am at the moment having a beautiful row with Gamages over a bill, which I am pretty certain was paid long ago, but as I haven't the mess accounts, I can't make certain. Anyhow they are threatening legal proceedings. Love to all Jack. ",1916-12-06,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from C G and O. I am very glad G. got home unscathed as those beastly submarines were always on my mind. The telescope has arrived lens and all and fills the heart of the Sniping Officer with delight. I will let you know how it works and how many Bosches we bag with it, when I can. It seems in very good order. At present we are out of the line so it is lying doggo. It is a beastly day and I am very glad to be in a house, owing to Haig or someone going on leave. I shall have the Battalion on my hands again for a few days, as when he goes the Army Commander goes to the G. H. Q. and our Corps Commander to the Army, our Divl. bloke to the Corps, Brigadier to the Division, and Irvingham to the Brigade. Anyhow it works somehow like this. Jo has returned from his school, where he appears to have enjoyed himself without overwork and to have impressed his capabilities on the commandant as the latter wanted to keep him as an instructor, but the C. O. wouldn't hear of it, I am glad to say. The Bosch opposite was very joyful at the fall of Bucharest, and rang bells and sang ditties in honour thereof and got properly strafed in consequence. He seems to be wanting to copy our example in raids lately, but has caught a tartar once or twice lately, so perhaps hiss giddy ardour is subdued. I always expect to meet a Bosch in our trenches when going round at night. I heard of a Battalion the other day who proudly claimed the capture of a prisoner and it turned out that a miserable little Bosch about 18 years old had lost his way on patrol and had got into our lines and gone to sleep in an empty dug-out. He came afoot in the morning and was at once captured by an officer, who had no arms himself, luckily the Bosch had left his rifle in the dug out and the officer was so pleased with his capture that he wouldn't leave him but took him all the way back to Corps Headquarters. I hear that the Roumanians are moving so fast that even the Bosch Bosch cavalry can't catch them. still the Bosch must be losing a certain number of men in the process, which is all to the good, as I believe he has got his 1919 class in the depots in Germany now Love to all Jack. ",1916-12-08,Father
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for another excellent box of cigars, which I very greatly appreciate. Please thank Mother C G and O for lots of letters books and papers. I had a truly enormous post from the family to-day and I am the envy of everyone. Irvingham is still away so I am looking after the shop, while he surveys from a higher sphere in the Brigade office. From various small indications I can't help thinking that he is in the running for a Brigade himself, though how it will affect me if he goes I don't know. We have had a senior officer of the line sent to us in the last few days and it made things a bit awkward, as he has at least 15 yrs. regular service and has been home wounded twice. However he has been here for 3 days in the capacity of a visitor and has to-day gone to a school as an instructor, and I fancy that if it has been definitely decided that he was eventually to have the Battn. he would not have been sent away. However I think he is of opinion that he is to have it and of course from his point of view he ought. It is all in the air and there may be nothing in it. He is quite a good fellow and knows his job, but whether he would make a good C. O. I have not seen enough of him to say. I am sorry to hear about Aunt Meamie and hope she is better now. We had a really good concert when we were out the other day and produced some surprising talent in two professionals. We also took the precaution to bar the people who usually sing, as they are all bad and we know their songs by heart, so the thing was quite a success. I am rather anxious at the moment, as I am half anticipating a raid by the Bosch. The difficulty is that my suspicions are so slight, that I can't make the preparations I could if I knew more. However I ought to know definitely to-morrow what is in the wind, and provide accordin'. I hope we catch him on the bend. The bucolic peace that used to pervade this place has rather died away lately and it is now no unusual occurrence to hear a rifle bullet and a shell. Whether we or the Bosch is the aggressor I do not know, but things are getting much more normal and rather what one expects in trench warfare. Love to all Jack. A fellow has just joined who was billeted with Arthur Ellis at Epsom when the Public Schools Battalion was there. I have not yet discovered his name. ",1916-12-13,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from yourself Father C. and G. -- also for a book from Cecily by Bairnsfather. It is quite interesting and he writes about some trenches we were in at one time. The news of the French show at Verdun should make the Bosch sit up and put forth more peace proposals. The incident I mentioned in my last letter to Father has come off -- it came off the night I wrote. It is curious that I am almost always in charge of the panto. when these little things come off and I am pleased to say that there are a fewer Bosches now than there were and we are precisely as we was, except being a little -- just the slightest bit - ^ more pleased with one another than before and fewer harsh words have been spoken and more daily acts of kindness done than before. We have been visited by the minor planets of the martial constellation while the major ones have shed their kindly beams on us, and we are bathed in their smiles. There is no news. The Trench Mortar Officer I told you of, has got promoted or blown up or something. Anyhow we have a new one, who dropped one of his beastly bombs in our front line this afternoon and wreck wrecked a most beautiful bit of trench, the only decent bit we've got. We like Trench Mortar Officers at times, but nooone could love this person and I shall have pleasure in telling him so to-morrow. Love to all Jack ",1916-12-16,Mother
"My dear Family, this should reach you about Xmas and I wish you all as good a time as is possible in the circs. Unfortunately I shall not be there to shed the light of my countenance at the festive board and in the ordinary course will be in the front line at the time, but I daresay we shall imagine to amuse ourselves and it should be a busy day as everyone gets very nervous in case the other people are going to do the dirty on them and our staff seem anxious that the events of Xmas 1914 shall not be repeated and Football Matches Briton very Bosch in No Mans Land are taboo. Also photographing parties, such as Bairnsfather mentions in his book. Officially of course there are No Cameras in the Army, though I have heard it hinted that this order is not always obeyed. Many thanks for letters, 2 cakes and eatables, papers, a Book more cigars -- in fact every thing that the heart of man desires. We are out of the line and the C. O. is back, so the normal regime continues so far as I am concerned. I am going back to-morrow to seek a dentist as I have lost a stopping, which needs to be replaced. I am sorry C. had such a rotten time at her concert. It will make her think twice before she goes again, I fancy. The weather is cold and there is frost about, but the previous occupants have managed to start a fireplace in my dug out and ^ as we are now buying coal to supplement the daily rotation we manage to carry on all right. It is very clear to-day, consequently the aeroplanes are busy and our guns have done a lot of shooting, which has stirred up the Bosch and he now seems inclined to retaliate on us. Luckily he has not got much ammunition so he can't do much. I have now developed into a kind of Battalion Banker, as so much money has been lost by Officers owing to their being in the line, that I keep it all and it is nothing for me to be wandering round with 7000 francs on my person and more in the valise. The first day I had it I lost 490 francs, but recovered it eventually, as I had been doling out 20 franc notes as though they were only 10 francs. At present I have only lost 15 francs, but expect someone to come along with that soon. I enclose Xmas presents for the Olive branches^ £5 each I don't know what to get for the parent stem yet but will see what can be done. Love to all Jack. P. S. The cigars are excellent. I get a book from Hatchards weekly, in fact I have several on hand at the moment as I was rather busy last week.",1916-12-20,Family
"My dear Family, Many thanks for many letters – also for a bottle of drink, some food & biscuits. I am sorry not to have written for the last 2 or 3 days, but am rather busy as the C. O. is again away commanding another Brigade temporarily, & Peter Bye is away getting married I fancy, but he is a sly dog & won't own to it. Anyhow he is away from the Battn. if he is not on leave, so there is plenty to do. The men are having their Xmas dinners & we are feeding them by Companies daily & the first two have gone off very well, but I hear to-day that there is no fresh meat issue to-morrow, so I have had to spend 300 frs. in buying meat & the Canteen is nearly broke. I hope the fresh meat materialises the day after, or we shall be bankrupt. I saw the New Year in with a win of 50 frs. which is a good omen. The following day I had a dose of an army dentist, who was quite the most noxious specimen of the tribe I have run across. Luckily the tooth was dead, as he broke 3 instruments on it & kept up a running comment with his assistant as to where he had got to & how things were looking all the time. I have got to go to him again but will try to put it off when the time comes & see our George when I get back. There is a rumour that Irvingham is going to stop where he is now, as they say that the man, who has nominally gone on leave, is not coming back. I don't know if there is any truth in it, but suppose I shall discover fairly soon, & then my eventual position will be settled. I am going for a joy ride with the G. O. C. in a couple of days time on some futile job, so I must endeavour to impress the good man with my suitability. Love to all Jack. ",1917-01-02,Family
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last, also for letters from the gals. I am sorry you have all had colds but hope they are on the mend by now. The weather is too beastly for words & it is a wonder that the whole British army is not down with something of the sort, yet somehow we don't seem to be worried with them. I suppose the healthy open air life has something to do with it, yet there are many who could do with a little less of the open air. I am sorry not to have written for a few days, but have plenty to occupy my time & have really been rather pushed the last few days. When we were back the men had their Xmas dinners by companies & we fed them with Plum puddings & beer & I fancy they enjoyed themselves. Also the sergeants had a dinner & there were concerts & a cinema not far off so they got a fair amount of amusement. I had a joy ride in a car one day to see a demonstration of some of our engines of warfare but there was nothing that I hadn't seen before, so that part was not very interesting though the whole thing took me all day, but I quite enjoyed the run. We are now in the line again & find the Bosch fairly quiet though his minnies cause a little trouble & a lot of work in rebuilding trenches after he has knocked them in & the weather rather helps him than otherwise. We have got a strange Colonel attached to us now, who seems fairly innocuous. He is a Welshman & a Territorial & was out in the Dardanelles, so he knows nothing of this front. I don't know how long I shall have to look after him, but I think only for 5 days. Perhaps Irvingham will be back soon & take him off my hands. I hope you saw your son & heir in the paper the other day. I suppose it was because of the raid last June, as I don't feel conscious of anything else unusual since then. I don't fancy that this Div. did very well in the list, at least the Divl. Staff didn't think so, though of course they were all mentioned, but there certainly are several people who ought to get things & don't. The truth is that those who deserve them most are the ones who try to get things out of the higher authorities & are consequently not popular with the latter. I hear we are going right back some time, but these rumours get about & are rarely accurate so we may or may not get out, but I don't think any objections would be raised if we did. Love to all Jack.

"My dear Father, I am sorry to hear that your larynx is not as tractable as it might be & hope you are really better now & that a little rest has not done any permanent injury. Please thank everyone for letters & a box of chocolate dates & several novels. Nothing of immediate interest has happened the last week – we have been out of the front line & are now in again with lots of snow to keep us warm. It shows signs of thawing, so I do not anticipate a very pleasant time for the men. I have no reason to be pitied, (this as I see that G & O. are inclined to waste sympathy) as I live very comfortably in dry dug outs with fires & am quite in clover, particularly as there are lots of us in a confined space & consequently keep each other warm. Irvingham was back for one night, but has gone again as an acting Brigadier, what time the real one is away sick. I have doubts about his sickness, as there are rumours that he is for home, but know nothing for certain & anyhow I am running the concern for the moment & I suppose shall continue to do so for a few days, as if the C. O. comes back he is going to our own Brigade, as some of the higher authorities are going on leave. The Major man from our 1st. Battn. has now been sent off to command it, so his claims are disposed of for the moment & we are as we was. He is quite a good chap & quite knowledgeable but I am not sorry that he has gone. Gery Clayton has come back & is at the moment acting as 2nd in C. as he is doubtful whether he is not to be sent off as adjutant of another Battalion. I am sorry to hear of Mother's chill, & hope she has got over the worst of it now. I think you have all been working too hard. I don't think I acknowledged the last box of cigars, which came 2 or 3 days ago & which are very good… Will you cease sending the Bystander now as we get a copy for the mess? The Autocar continues to arrive with unfailing regularity. Love to all Jack. ",1917-01-17,Father 
"My dear G. Many thanks for yours of the 15th, which I got to-day – much more speedily than usual as the post has been very dicky lately. The drink arrived at the same time, for which I have written to J. R. P. I don't know that there is any immediate prospect of leave till I have done 6 months from the last at the least. Since I wrote yesterday there is nothing much to tell you. We had a worried night as the Bosch insisted on strafing violently at odd intervals & we didn't know what he was playing at. However he didn't try any tricks so it did not matter much, except that he disturbed my repose. He is rather irritable at the moment & what with the snow & our artillery I don't blame him. I hope Weelaum is flourishing, but if the mail boat has gone down, I suppose you will miss a letter or so, though I imagine he is a very poor correspondent, particularly if he is out in the wilds. I have nothing to say & several things to do at the moment so my love to all Jack. ",1917-01-18,Glad 
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last, also for birthday letters from Father & the 3 girls, & for 2 bottles of drink & a box of cigars – all very tasty. The cake has not yet arrived, but we have got another which was sent to our Transport Officer, whose birthday is to-day, so we have shared that. It is still very cold & dry & there is lots of snow on the ground, which must have been there now for 3 weeks. Things seem very quiet at the moment. There has been a lot of heavy artillery fire in the distance for some days, but it has stopped to-day & was probably due to the Bosch stunt in Belgium a few says ago. I was to have gone down to Boulogne for a week from to-morrow on a sort of conference which is held periodically & for which they haul infantry officers out of the line & it might have been rather interesting, but as the C. O. is off again for 10 days in 48 hours time, my joy ride has been cancelled. I don't know anyhow that there is much to do at Boulogne but it would have been a change from associating with the Bosch. Please tell Father that alas his telescope is no more as the Bosch dropped a Minnie on it & all they have recovered is a bit of twisted brass & part of the eyepiece. How on earth the men using it got off I don't know as their post, which was a small dug out let into the thickness of the parapet, completely disappeared but they turned up all right, rather shaken but intact. I was watching one of ours the other day, which landed in a house behind the Bosch lines. At the start the house wasn't so bad – that is to say it had 4 walls & most of its roof, but when the flying pig, as we call ours, had done its work the house had completely disappeared & it only took one round to do the trick. I have just been making up the Battalion Pay accounts & have apparently made 90 frs. out of the Government. I may say that it is very difficult to make a penny our of them, so if it is correct I deserve great credit. However I shall probably find in time that they have made it out of me. It works out to a big figure – about 20000 frs a month I have to account for & the system is not so easy to work as the authorities would have us believe. My teeth are quite all right & give no trouble, though as I told you I had to visit the Army dentist once. Love to all Jack. ",1917-02-02,Mother
"My dear Mother, I am over the water again after a good crossing & going up this afternoon. I dined with Jo last night & went to another theatre, though my original intention had been to go to bed early. Love to all Jack. I have sent a cheque to the bank for the 3 girls as an unbirthday present",1917-03-18,Mother 
"My dear Glad, Many thanks for yours – also for others from mother C & O. I hope someone has been able to find a suitable offering for Rosamond, as I have not the slightest idea what form it should take. We are in the line & wishing for the real spring, as the weather is very nearly quite respectable but it persists in snowing at odd intervals & the melting operations entail a slushy state in the trenches. The Bosch seems to want to be inactive but our people behind insist on strafing, so we get it back in a minor degree. He is also very nervy and flares up for nothing whatever. Unfortunately he seems to know exactly where our mess is & where my own little bed is hidden & drops whizz bangs nearby in a most disconcerting manner. Luckily I don't mind how many whizz bangs he puts over as my roof is impregnable to whizz bangs & I am only praying that the whizz bang man doesn't go & dine with anyone connected with the 5.9's or they may like to have a go & we shall have to emigrate. Weve been trying to collar a Bosch the last few days to add to the collection & there is a small party out hunting one now but I don't know if they will have any luck as there is lots of moon. The C. O. is still away and won't be back for several days. A kitten has adopted us at the moment & is walking about this letter as I write. He or she insists on sitting down on the page & blotted the last most successfully. It is now playing with a whiskey bottle cork on our snow white napery or (to be truthful) dingy grey tablecloth which may or may not have been white once. I must introduce it to the puppy, if the latter is old enough, but I have not seen it since I came back. I have nothing to talk about except military matters, which are taboo & I haven't been half a mile from the trenches since I came out so I haven't come into contact with civilian affairs. I hear they have taken to shelling the area where we go back to rest, so I suppose we shall now have to sleep in cellars there & they used to have beautiful beds & sheets. I hear the Brigade have to share a cellar with 3 female proprietresses of their billet, the latter decently curtained of but the padre's modesty is shocked as he has to pass through their billet bedroom to get to his own. I hear the Hun hunters are on their way in so must cease. They have been out for an hour or more, but I have heard no signs of trouble & assume they have had no luck. Love to all Jack.

"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last, also for others from C. G & O & various books and papers. I hope G. is all right again. We are out of the line in billets & would be very comfortable except for guns which are all round & about us & hem us in on every side. Likewise where there are guns there do the Bosch shells go also, so we keep underground as much as possible when there are storms about. You will see from the papers that what I told you of has at last come off & they appear to have rolled up the Bosch fairly successfully & got over 2000 of them to keep. I don't fancy the Bosch is to be left to himself. I see the papers are fairly gloomy, & old Balfour has been as pessimistic as he was about the Jutland show. Anyhow we are not done as regards the air here, though the Bosch is rather more enterprising, but he certainly can't come over & do as he likes though I believe we haven't got the same freedom as usual. From all the reports I see he has quite as many machines driven down as we do & it will only be the matter of a little time before we have the upper hand as before. It was exactly the same on the Somme last year & we didn't really scare him off for 3 or 4 weeks after the start. Hamilton the adjutant got a blighty through his leg to-day & the Quartermaster & his Sergeant are sick, so our staff is sadly depleted & I am trying to think of someone who will ensure us getting our daily bread & can't put my hands on anyone at the moment. I hear that the people on the Somme are having the time of their lives, as they have all got little shows to run on their own & they get right away from the heavy guns & strafe each other with normal weapons to their hearts content. I don't know what the Bosch thinks of this Vimy show but he will be put to it to have another big show on his hands in addition to the Somme, & I hear that ^ the Vimy ^ Ridge was to have been held at all costs Love to all Jack.

"My dear Glad, Thanks for your letter of the 16th received to-day also for one from Cecily of the 15th. I have had others from Mother & you three recently but think I acknowledged them. I have also had a letter and a box of cigars from Father for which many thanks. Another post has just arrived with a book from Cecily, for which I am grateful. Since I last wrote we have been moved out of the line and are now well back & going back further in a day or two and should get at least a fortnight away from the war. I don't quite know why, but everyone seems very pleased with the Division. Our Brigade certainly had some hard fighting and did very well, but we hadn't much to do except chase the retreating Bosch and simply advanced as far as he let us. I think we were on his heels much earlier than he expected, and consequently got a good deal more ground than he intended us to have. One Brigade got all sorts of stores which the Bosch would never have left it he could help it. At the moment we are in a very nice billet. A country house run by some ancient sisters of mercy as a cottage hospital and almshouse. We have got their best room & a good stove & I have a good bedroom with the Maire. We have got the local Brewery to bath the men in & the school as a Recreation Room, so the men are not so badly off. When we arrived yesterday we thought we were here for some time, but to-day they tell us we are going back further & I hope we find as good a spot next time. the weather is ever so much warmer & if spring has really come, we should have a very pleasant fortnight before us. One of the sisters is now busy reading prayers to the patients next door. She has uttered a ceaseless flow for 10 minutes, so I presume the patients are by now asleep. Anyhow they are very quiet. I hope you have a good time at Havre. Perhaps you will be there when the Limerick warriors return as the old Bosch certainly seems to have something to think about now & one may presume that there is more to come. Excuse the envelope. Love to all Jack. ",1917-04-21,Glad 
"My dear Father, Many thanks for two letters & R. k's book, which I was very anxious to read, as I had only just heard it was out and read a review on it. Many thanks also for the offer of a telescope, which we shall be very glad to have, but I tremble for its fate, as it will probably go the way of the two others. We have done another march and are not far from the spot where we spent our first 3 weeks in this country. Absolutely in the depths of bucolicism & almost out of hearing of guns. I gather that the Bosch is doing all he knows to stop us & wasting any number of men in futile counter attacks so I suppose he will keep it up for a bit till the pressure gets to great & then things ought to move. The French here are fairly amiable, but we are so far from the line that they are not used to troops & are making too much money out of their farms to be bothered with soldiers. We had great difficulty in billeting at first with regard to officers beds & messes, as there can be no compulsion but now we have arrived they have changed their attitude a bit. The weather is very various with occasional indications that there is a sun somewhere & that there is a season known as spring. At the moment I am basking in the sun, but carefully out of the wind, which is distinctly chilly. Please thank Mother C. G & O for letters. I am sorry they are taking Burridge, as you will be in difficulties with him away. However I suppose everyone is or will be in the same boat & nothing much is said nowadays when a fluffy damsel lets at £2000 a year house on a 99 year lease at a £50 rental. I should think the trusty Tomlin might come in useful. I spent the morning riding round the training area & billets. The latter are very scattered – about 4 or 5 kilometres along a road, so it takes some little time to see them all. The training area appears to be completely sown with crops, so I don't see that we can do much training over it. However there may be a patch here & there, where we can extend a few men. The question of baths & washing clothes is now the trouble, as we have no facilities such as a brewery which served the purpose at our last halt. However we shall probably unearth a cauldron or two somewhere & then wash the men anywhere. We are on a small river, so the water question does not trouble. Love to all Jack. ",1917-04-26,Father
"My dear Mother, Thanks for your last & for others from C & O. I don't know what has happened as I have written pretty frequent lately. I think 2 letters have gone to G. so you may not have seen them. Anyhow we are not hun hunting or anywhere near them, except a few prisoners which are knocking about. They seem to look after themselves & have very little escort. Someone saw a party get into a lorry & when they were in their escort, a single & ancient warrior handed them up his rifle & bayonet & then they pulled him in, so you see that they are all quite friendly. We did a longish march yesterday & have had a day's rest to-day & more again to-morrow but we are nowhere near the line & no one seems to know yet when & where we are going back. Anyhow we are quite out of the hearing of war noises such as guns or aeroplanes The G. O. C. was round this morning & had us on parade & made a speech & then shook us all by the hand, so it looks as if he is going, but he didn't say anything. However there seems to be a rumour that he is off on some other job & we wonder what we are going to get in his place. We are fairly comfortable in a straggling village, but the weather is so beautiful, that we are out in the fields most of the day. We have a tame canal where the Battalion disported itself this afternoon quite unashamedly in spite of the numerous ladies along the tow paths & in various barges They didn't seem to mind. the barges are enormous things towed indiscriminately by a tug-pair of horses or the barges family – the latter down to the smallest infant each toting its own rope & the whole moving about 1/8th mile per hour in favourable circumstances. The canal water is inclined to be classified as ""polluted"" but I had quite a decent bathe in it, in spite of the scum on the surface. We are living with the most sanctimonious family I have ever come across. They have a picture with a light before it in their dining room, a wall covered with the portraits of fat & unctuous priests & even the table cloth is embroidered with pictures of the apostles in various poses. They must be dreadful people to live with but we don't see anything of them. I see Olive says I must be having a dreadful time. We haven't been within range for 3 weeks & there seem to be no immediate signs of their sending us back. Altogether I am enjoying myself very much. I hope you have good weather & enjoy yourself in Cornwall. Love to all Jack. ",1917-05-11,Mother
"My dear Mother, Thanks for your last & for papers & books. I hope you are getting good weather & a rest as I expect you need it & from what I can gather now that Odd has done it, that you are not required to assist. I suppose she & the young man will run the housekeeping together & lord help the household as they will probably starve. However they won't mind in the circumstances. I hope Lillie & the other relations are well and flourishing. We are out of the trenches after a fairly strenuous tour & back in reserve, but not exactly out of things as the Bosch is now shelling our front door. Consequently I do not intend to go out, as long ^ nothing smaller than his biggest could get into this place (a cellar with 30 ft of earth & trees on top) & he has no really big guns here so far as I know. The Bosch tried to raid us twice the last time we were in. Once he got driven off & the other time unfortunately he took off one of our men – both time with casualties. Love from Jack. ",1917-05-21,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for the box of cigars you sent, which reached me yesterday. I also got a card from Odd from Dorking to-day. We are still nominally in reserve & expect to go back to the trenches the day after to-morrow. Actually I was up there all last night, as things were very active & 2 of our Companies were sent up to support. I fancy the Bosch intended to attack, but he got so many guns on him that his attack never materialised, though he made two attempts. Our partic- ular piece seems to be very unhealthy especially as the people on either side get nothing. It was rather interesting last night, as we were just out of it all & could watch the whole proceedings. These little shows are really a good deal worse than the bigger ones, as they get the artillery concentrated on them & if you don't happen to be in the middle, they are a very fine sight & even if you are in them it is extraordinary how few casualties are caused. I don't know that there is any particular news. Love to Odd Jack ",1917-05-23,Father 
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter. It is very good of you to go on getting telescopes. We have got quite a respectable number at the moment so I would not care to waste another in the trenches, particularly as one rather anticipates a warmer time. I should however much like to have one in reserves, for use if necessary or to replace a broken one. Did I thank you for that last box of cigars? They were quite good and mellow. We are out of the line & in a monastery we were in 3 weeks ago. Being Sunday the monks (Trappists) are now having Vespers & singing a tune I know but cannot place – one of the Easter Hymns I think with alterations. It is a perfect day & I have been basking all the afternoon. The air is stiff with aeroplanes of all kinds, as we are close to a couple of aerodomes & they are coming in & going out all day. I saw a number of our new ones the other day – triplanes. I also saw one of our balloons brought down by a Bosch. It was a long way off, but made quite a fine blare. I don't know what happened to the occupants but assume they got off, as they usually do. The beer question is my only worry at the moment, as it is my job to produce beer for the men & I can't get any anywhere for some unaccountable reason. And they feel it very much. I shall have to steal a lorry somewhere & send a long way back till they find some, as I shall never be forgiven. I had a note from Newton Binney the other day but have not had a chance to see him. He is not far off but his crowd are in the line I fancy. Yours Jack",1917-06-03,Father
"My dear Father, Very many happy returns of the day. I am sorry to have been late in writing but what with the Bosch & other things I have been preoccupied. We have been in close support for the last few days and are now going in to the line – for ordinary trench work I imagine. Anyhow it will be in what were Bosch trenches so we shall have plenty to do to make them habitable. The Bosch comments on the Messines show are really humourous I see that in one place he claims that it ended in his favour, from which statement one can only conclude that he expected to lose 60000 & has only lost 50000 It is already very noticeable what a difference the loss of view makes to his shelling as he strafes away for all he is worth & no one is anywhere near to receive the benefit. The weather is rather hot, but we have had a little rain lately to cool things & altogether it is not unpleasant. The Bosch put a number of gas shells over last night, so I tried to sleep in a gas helmet – a difficult operation & I was not successful. However the trouble did not last more than half an hour. I don't know that they were intended for us, but as we live close to a number of batteries we come in for some of their troubles as well as our own. I saw a number of extracts from letters taken from prisoners lately. They all seem very fed up, but seem to bear it all fairly well. Apparently their officers leave them in the front line entirely to their own devices & live a long way back themselves paying an occasional visit when things are quiet to see that their men are still there. I don't fancy that our men would appreciate that kind of thing. Love to all Jack. ",1917-06-13,Father 
"My dear Father, By this time you should have got my last letter. No watch has reached me & if it has not been sent I should prefer that you should keep it for the present anyhow, as there is every chance that I should lose it & my own is going well. My best congratulations on the success of the potato patch which is a great triumph. Will you keep it going till the autumn or dig them up earlier? I wrote to Olive yesterday but am afraid I was too late for the wedding & you may accordingly have sent my letter on unopened. We are in the line but go out to-night after a fairly strenuous time, both sides being very active with their artillery, but otherwise the tour has been without incident. I am anticipating one or two completely idle days while we are behind as the Battalion will be very much split up & we live in a deep dug-out away from any of the Companies which are attached to other people for the time being. So really there should be nothing to do. As it is no district in which to take constitutionals I suppose I shall spend most of my time underground. Please thank Mother & G. for their letters. I hope Jane behaved herself when being christened. Yrs Jack. ",1917-06-16,Father 
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from you & G. to-day & one from G. yesterday. I was v. glad to have the news of the wedding & to hear that it went off well. I suppose the Record or Herald will come out with some sort of an account. Will you cut it out & let me see it? I am back again from the other crowd I was with two days ago as they have found one of their own officers to command them. However I was with them for a couple of days & found it very interesting. We are by way of being out of the line for 4 days for rest, but this looks more than it is as the first night is entirely occupied with the process of relief & I spent last night up there looking round the new area we are going to & only got back here wet to the bone at 8 this morning, the weather having changed suddenly at 5 & caught me without a coat. We had arranged a concert for the men this afternoon in a neighbouring village, but it was off as the Bosch has taken to strafing the place & they don't like collecting a lot of men together under those conditions. It was a pity, as the troupe, which incidentally is run by Newton Bennings Division, is very good & put up an excellent show. We have a troupe too, but at the moment they have no place to act in & I don't think they are much good anyhow. I think the C. O is going to have a short rest when we go in next, as he has been rather seedy & the accommodation at our new Hqrs is distinctly limited, viz one small concrete Bosch dugout which has just room for 3 inside & in which one has to sleep feed & do office work. From what I could see & hear of it the place is not so active as the last we were in, so we hope for a quieter time. We then hope to go back some way for an appreciable time, but these plans are too far sighted to be a certainty, as rule 1 of all war operations entails the necessity of altering all previous views as near the last moment as possible. Love from Jack. ",1917-06-22,Mother
"My dear Mother, I have several letters to thank you all for and 2 cakes. Since my last letter I have had a variegated time and am at the moment well behind the line & out of the sound of guns and warfare generally. We hope for at least a fortnight here – here being a small & pretty little French village which just accommodates us all comfortably with beds for all the officers. It has been quite a rapid move as I only left the front line trenches at 4 a m yesterday morning & got here at 11 p m last night. We had a moderate time for our 3 days in the line, as the artillery was very active, as also the Bosch patrols. They evidently did not know their position, as they are in one of their old line of trenches. Their aeroplanes are very active too & ours are not very much in evidence at the moment, though they turn up occasionally & chase him off. A whole lot of Bosches came over the other day & did stunts about 500 feet above our line, and as all their machines are painted in brilliant & various hues, we rather enjoyed the display. I fancy our people are being given a bit of a rest as they had a hard time at the beginning of the month & things seem to have settled down for the moment anyhow. However they will no doubt turn up again when the time comes. We were in rather an interesting part of the line on the high ground while the Bosch is in the plain below & we could see his guns firing, so the artillery should have no difficulty in laying them out when they want to. I went over one of the old Bosch positions where he used to look over us from & it was extraordinary how much he could see whereas now he can only see things from his balloons which will cease to exist when necessary – so the tables are nicely turned. I have also recently seen one or two of our balloons brought down. They burn very well & disappear before they reach the ground. It is quite a fine sight, as at the same moment the sky is full of the occupants of all the neighbouring balloons – each in his own parachute descending slowly to the Earth. They have to nip out pretty quickly or the balloon drops on top of them & they don't waste any time about it. When in the line we lived in an old Bosch dug-out made of solid concrete and about 9 ft by 16 ft by 6 ft high inside & most uncomfortable. 3 of us & a signaler crowd into this & most unfortunately the Bosch knows exactly where it is & the thinnest side & doorway is towards him, but it would stand a good deal & the only damage he did was to smash up most of our mess plate (otherwise some enameled plates & mugs). However it was distinctly uncomfortable at the times when he was shooting at it. Luckily there was a rather better one a little way off which we didn't use but which he wasted most of his shells on. There are a lot of concrete dug outs about the place. I don't know how he manages to make them as we never could, but he seems to have had concrete galore. A number have been knocked in by our heavy guns, but a lot have survived & they come in very usefully. I have got a very good billet in a farm & a most comfortable bed, & if the weather is fine we ought to have a very good time, but we have had a lot of storms lately, & when it does rain you get soaking wet in no time. We are also in a land flowing with strawberries & cream, so we have come out at the right time. Unfortunately we are some miles from an anglicised town, so it may be difficult to get things we want. Love to the family. I trust Jane is in form. Yrs Jack. ",1917-06-28,Mother
"My dear Father, I have several letters of yours to acknowledge, which I was very glad to get. I enclose cheque for 65 /- for the car premium. I have to-day paid the Comm. Union £3. 0. 10 for my policy 20362 in the Hand in Hand. This is the premium 3. 1. 11 less the usual 1/1 commission. I shall be greatly obliged if you will inquire if they get it, as the thing expires on the 5th. prox & I anticipate being fairly busy as Irvingham is probably off on leave in a few days. We are about to go back into the line & I am going up to have a look round to-night. I happen to know the district fairly well which makes things easier We are in bivouacs at the moment but have a farm to mess in & the men are comfortable, as the weather is dry. We ran across some men of one of our other battalions whom we have not met before though we have met all the others including the 13th labour Battn. at one time or another. yrs Jack.

"My dear Father, Many thanks for your last letters. I think it will be best to insure the pram, if possible at the reduced rate & if you will find out what the premium is & pay it, I will send you a cheque. Many thanks for troubling about it. I fear that another telescope will not be of much use at the moment, as the line is too unsettled to be able to do more than a limited amount of observation work & we have sufficient telescopes for the purpose. I have written a line to Glad to-day, but have little news. We are still in our retired village & consequently there is little to talk about. I hear that George & Mary have both arrived to-day. Yrs Jack",1917-07-03,Father
"My dear Glad, Thanks for several letters from you and one from Mother to-day. I greatly admire the photographs of Jane & had no idea that I had such a ponderous godchild. I also duly admired the yellow tuft. I don't know that there is any news. We are still far from the battle & beginning to get some training done. It is very pleasant out here if a trifle dull, but one can't have everything. I had a day's jaunt yesterday, as I had to go on a Court Martial 30 miles away & had a very good run in a car both ways. I saw lots of preparations being made for George, so I suppose he is having a look round. Anyhow they evidently intend to do him well as the red baire & exotic flowers were much in evidence. I daresay we shall see something of him as we are near at hand (that is the Division is & with nothing particular to do so he may review us in his spare moments. There is a suggestion that we shall do a tour by easy stages to the sea & have a day or two there if the weather keeps fine & I think the men would like it. I had a chance to do a little shopping too yesterday which I rather needed, as we are so far in the wilds here that we are out of touch with all civilization. I have not heard what presents Odd got except that they were numerous & costly & I should be very interested to hear, if someone would mind giving me an idea of what they were. Many thanks for books & papers. Love to all Jack",1917-07-03,Glad
"My dear Mother, I have neglected to write, I fear, for a few days, but I have had rather a lot to do as the C. O. is in England for a few days on a special job, & returns at the end of the week. The Brigade had a transport show here on Saturday (I believe to-day is Monday but am never quite sure of the days of the week) which was quite good fun. It was a lovely day & quite one to spend watching other people & animals exert themselves. As a Battalion we got quite a number of prizes – more than anyone I fancy. The best event was a mule race with 5 jumps & it was very surprising how well some of the mules could go. They provided lots of amusement too – one heat broke off in the middle in a body & tried to go back to their lines & it was quite a rare event if any of them kept to the track the whole way round. Needless to say we won that race, as it was on our own ground & our own men were everywhere to keep our mules to the strait & narrow way. Yesterday we had a long afternoon of our own Battalion sports which were quite a success & produced a number of really good runners whom no one knew of. We have got our Drums going again. We lost them at Loos & never troubled to start them ^ since but they blossomed out yesterday. They are not as bad as they might be & will no doubt improve. I hope this air raid came nowhere near any of you. They have got snuff for it anyhow, but I fear it won't stop yet though they may avoid London for a bit. I was very interested to hear that G. had seen the Japs. I suppose they were not Chinese, as there are a number of them out here I believe working behind the lines somewhere. I can't help thinking the Bosch is getting a little frightened as to his ultimate end & there seems to be that impression everywhere. Nothing tangible but there seems to be every sign that he now knows he is fighting a losing cause & though we have known it some time I doubt if he has. They are talking of making us walk a matter of 50000 miles to go by the sea & back but I resisted stoutly yesterday & hope we shall not have to do it. We should only have 24 hours there anyhow & it hardly seems worth while. Our Doctor has been sent off temporarily & we have a new man who seems quite a good chap. Love to all Jack. P. S. Many thanks for letters & books. I now have 3 books unread, so please stay your generous hands. I have written a similar letter to Cecily. ",1917-07-08,Mother
"My dear Mother, I have several letters to thank you all for, a couple of cakes. I am very glad to hear the Barrow's show was a success & shall be interested to read Sam's speech when the Herald materialises. I haven't written for a few days, as I have been rather busy & the last two days we have been on the move. We have been marching & had quite a respectable journey so far though inclined to be a little wet. We start at or before dawn & get in before the heat of the day, which is quite a satisfactory plan, though it breaks up the night's rest. I imagine we shall have a few more days & then shall probably be sent into the line somewhere. When I get a chance I will send back the wedding photographs. I cannot congratulate French on his efforts as it was all I could do to recognise most of the relations & I only got at G. by a process of elimination. The C. O. is back again but is rather ill & will I think get an extended leave as soon as possible to get fit. The strain of this ere war is too much for him & he has consequently knocked up. We had a very good time when back in rest & kept the men busy with various competitions & games, concerts & cinemas – the latter in a church Army Tent which set itself down in our village, as being a central locality. Cinemas in a tent however are not a success, as they had to be held more or less by daylight & the light comes through the canvas. I gather that the higher luminaries are quite unperturbed by the Bosch show on the coast the other day. He was very wily & waited for a windy day & then bombarded the flank of the position so as to raise a dust storm, which blew down over our people & prevented their rifles & machine guns from working properly. I don't suppose he will be allowed to stay there for long. I don't know that there is any news. We are again reminded that there is a war on as we are just in sound of gunfire. Lately we have only realised it at nights as we could see the flashes on the sky & curiously enough, the flares presumably Bosch, as they are better than ours, sent up from the trenches Love to all Jack.

"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for your letters & best congratulations on your new job which I hope you will like. The boodle sounds attractive anyhow, though folk dancing sounds rather unpromising. I seem to remember hearing of them when I was up at New Coll. though rather in the way of jest than anything else. However things have probably altered by now & the jests were directed rather at the performers who were fat and elderly dons than at anyone else. Another letter has just come from you for which I am also obliged. Alas 6 months now has to elapse before leave comes again & I've only just done 4. I fear that once again shall I miss summer at home. However the weather here is very pleasant & is considerably enlivened by the war which persists in spite of all protests. As a matter of fact we are not in the war at the moment but resting fairly close behind. I assume that we shall be going back into the line soon, as no rest is indefinite. We are in camp with another battalion & had some impromptu sports & boxing with them yesterday which served to pass the time. We also had a concert in the evening but that was rather a dismal affair & no talent was forthcoming. I think the pianist was too much for them & he really was dreadful. We have had a new major man sent us to-day from home. He seems a good chap but being rather senior I expect he will be sent off somewhere before long. Love from Jack",1917-07-22,Cecily 
"My dear Mother, For once in a way I have nothing to acknowledge as we have had no posts for several days, the reason wherefore I know not, but presume its because we have been moving about. We are working our way back to the line by degrees & I expect they will send us in again soon as we have had a very pleasant month out of it. The weather is good again, too & so long as it continues we are very comfortable. We have had a new Major man sent out from home to-day. He seems a good chap but I've only seen him for a few minutes as he had to go off & hunt for his belongings which he lost on the way up. He is rather senior & whether he will stay or be sent somewhere else I don't know. We are in camp with another battalion & had some sports & boxing for the men yesterday afternoon & a concert in the evening – a truly awful show as the pianist was dreadful & the performers worse, for the most part, though a padré turned up with rather a good voice.

I wouldn't mind doing a song & dance myself at the lectures if I could come too, but I fancy Jenny Pluckers would defeat me without a lot of practise & we are too busy for that at the moment. We shall be going into the line in a day or two & I went up to have a look round yesterday, in the early morning when things were quiet. They are fairly active in this part as a rule but there are certain hours of the day which one carefully enquires into when the Bosches cease from troubling & then one can go round the line in comparative comfort. We took the Battn (a halt while I have been out to look for a Bosch aeroplane which is dropping eggs round here, but it is too dark to see it & our searchlights are too paralytic to help much. The archies are loosing off into the blue but even I can tell that they are at least a mile wide) to a Y. M. C. A. Cinema to-day, but it was too hot therein & the films were too romantic to attract me so I cleared off. On the way I passed a Church Army Hut which had an 11 inch shell alongside yesterday with the result that it is rather less of a Hut than it was. However I saw a bland smile peering through a hole in the side so presume that some of the staff are still in esse. I don't know how they rebuild these places but suppose they get help from the local military people as the natives are all busy on army work. Yrs Jack. ",1917-07-27,Cecily 
"My dear Glad. Many thanks for a letter from you to-day also for others from Mother & Father & for some shortbread, which is much appreciated. I am glad Jane is flourishing, but regret her determined temper. I notice that all the family comment on it & all say that it is acquired from her ma – so now you know. We are still back in bouviacs, but will be going up the line in two or three days. I was up in in the early hours yesterday morning having a look round, when things were quiet & incidentally got drenched, but it was only a passing storm & the weather is fine again & I trust it will remain so. I am rather busy at the moment as I have the running of the panto. on my hands & there are a lot of incidentals which want looking after. We took the men to a Cinema to-day, but it was too hot to be enjoyable, so I cleared off early. Incidentally I passed a church army Hut, which has just had an 11 inch shell bursting just outside, so it is not so ornamental as it was. The Bosch has learnt the trick of shelling back areas from us & is doing a lot more of it than he used to – with very little except moral effect & he certainly disturbs the Equanimity of Divisional Hqrs, which we poor P. B. I. don't mind very much, as we think it does them good to stir them up a little. Unfortunately when they do get a shell near them they talk of nothing else for days & other things are set aside. We have got a number of these little railways they have started running all over the place, just round this camp & they go wandering about up any sort of hill & must be extraordinarily useful. In this area they must comprise an enormous mileage as they are everywhere & one wonders how they used to get along without them. I ran across some Chinese working behind the line the other day. I believe there are a lot of them about & they must be pretty useful, as I gather that they are counting out our various labour battalions to send the men up to the line. Love from Jack. Hugo Watson is at Aldershot now as an instructor at the Senior Officers School. I had thought he was in Egyp. ",1917-07-27,Glad
"My dear Odd, Thanks for several letters from you. I fear I have not written lately but have been rather busy with one thing & another. However you have presumably heard that I am still going strong. We are still out of the line but expect to go back in a couple of days I went to have a look round our post yesterday & found it as attractive as most & at the moment fairly quiet (presumably because it was 5 a. m. as it has not a good reputation for placitude). I hope you like your new place. I hear suggestions that your Charlie should go to Walton for a week or two & wonder if you would like it, one of our fellows as was came form there Barry by name & as both his parents & wife & daughter all live in the place you may come across them if you go. He is not a bad chap, but likes the rearmost place in the battle & has managed to obtain a job in rear where there is lots of bravery but little danger. However war's war & somebody's got to be behind so why not he. As usual I have no news, at the moment bombs are dropping somewhere within hearing, but we are careful to extinguish our lights so as not to attract attention. I can hear the blighter but can't see him & our searchlights are too paralytic to help. They don't do any damage, but a tent won't keep them out, so it is as well to lie low. I expect one of our planes will be over shortly to cope with him. For a change we appear to have more or less command of the air & we rarely see a bosch now, though a month ago he used to do more or less as he liked & brought down lots of our balloons which make a very good blare & inwardly one wishes he would do it again occasionally, as a blaring balloon adds an interest to life. I counted 24 of ours up to-day, but narey a Bosch plane came near. Incidentally when he does come the air is at once full of hurried balloonists attached to parachutes which are a graceful & pleasing spectacle especially as the Bosch circles round them strafing the unfortunate bloke at the end of the parachute which must be very unpleasant though he rarely hits him However most of the balloonists joined to avoid trench work so we feel they deserve it sometimes. He now shells the balloons at long range & they dont like it at all but there again they only suffer from fright, as he never hits them. Love from Jack. ",1917-07-27,Odd
My dear Mother 6 a. m & I am about to go to bed but I just write to let you know that I have been in & am now out of the great strafe all serene. The Battn. did well & took all its objectives. I was in command as the C. O. stayed out. The weather is vile & the trenches we have made absolutely filthy. I am covered in mud & must wash. Love from Jack. ,1917-08-02,Mother 
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter of 29. 7. 17. I am sorry to hear you are losing weight, as you are probably overworking yourself & wish you could manage a holiday. This rain has come along & spoilt the whole battle for the present. It was extraordinarily difficult to get up to the line on the 30th owing to the state of the ground but when we came out yesterday the conditions passed imagination. The ground is so pulverised that it soaks up water like a sponge & the mud is indescribable & the further we go in to Bosch territory the worse our communications become. The Battn. had 2 objectives to take – an advance in all of about 1100 yds. & we got them both. Unfortunately the people on either flank did not with the result that we were lying out on a ridge sticking out towards the Bosch with his machine guns playfully dusting us whenever we moved. We got it pretty hot from his guns just before we came out & I expect that the people we handed over to will have to come back out of it & level with the rest. We got a fair number of prisoners – about 30 – 50 but it is impossible to say for certain. We were about the centre of the push. I hear that the Bosch collected a lot of men for a big counter attack North of us, so they got every gun they could in the army to bear on the area & they simply disappeared The aeroplanes couldn't do much good on the day of the show & we saw as many Bosch planes as our own, but neither side could do much with them. I don't know about leave. I am not due for it till the middle of September & if the C. O. takes a month before then I may have to wait. Yrs Jack",1917-08-03,Father
"My dear Glad, I have several letters to thank you for & am very glad to hear my god child is so fat & lusty. I trust that she is spanked sufficiently, but perhaps muzzling is the only thing that will do her any good. As you will have heard we have been in the big battle – though with the people on our right, a regular circus of a Division, it seemed to develop into a dog-fight & managed to get through with some little kudos & personally with complete safety. Unfortunately there was little booty though a number of our men are going about with Bosch watches & cigarette cases which they collared off their prisoners. The Bosch has given up wearing his helmet, so there are none of those to be found & the steel helmet he wears instead is not beautiful & rather heavy. There is no particular news at the moment This infernal rain is getting too much of a good thing & it absolutely declines to stop. I have never seen anything to equal the condition in the trenches we have just left & what the poor devils who took them over from us are doing now, as they were more than waterlogged when we left. However I gather that there is a heat wave in America & it may reach here & dry us up a bit. Love to Willie & Jane Yrs Jack",1917-08-03,Glad
"My dear Odd, Thanks for your last. They say you may now be going to Walton. If you want the pram – why not borrow it. You will have to get a license & I suppose you as a Doctors wife will be allowed juice by the gallon – but the pram is there if you want it. As you may know by now, we have been in the great battle & took all our objectives only thanks to the rain the Bosch has had a respite. If it had kept fire I should have been writing this from Berlin or some such place. I gather however that the Army Authorities are quite satisfied with the result up to now & will carry on when the ground dries up. They can certainly do nothing now. The ground is indescribable at the moment, having been pounded to bits by our artillery which & then the rain came & was soaked up like a sponge. I see the papers make very little of the show, though the results are far bigger than the Messines business – simply because there are not so many prisoners or guns captured. The number of guns he has had put out of action & the number of Divisions knocked about must be far greater than at Messines already & one can hardly imagine that we have finished our push yet. The people we met were quite a fresh lot, which in a way is a good thing, as it means that the first lot got knocked about by our guns for the days before the show & the second lot by us on the day. If they had not relieved the first one only one Division would have suffered. Unfortunately our Division is getting a reputation for strafing. our Brigade hasn't been in anything much before this year, but both the others have & have done all right & we did what we were wanted to this time, so we shall probably be treated to more of these shows later on. However we shall gain as we shan't be kept in the trenches so much. Thanks for another letter from London. I send this home as I don't know where you intend to stay Yrs Jack ",1917-08-03,Odd
"My dear Glad, Many thanks for your last letters, also for a cake from the A. & N. C. S. L. which I have not opened yet, as we happen to have one or two & the Herald with the Primrose League speeches reported. We are still out of the line & I do not expect we shall go back for several days. We have only been in the line 3 days since the end of June which is distinctly fortunate as the Brigade as a whole has been in much longer. It is drying up, but very unsettled & I suppose things have to wait on the weather, though one can hardly suppose the push has finished yet. We have just moved our camp, the last one being too muddy & damp for words, & we are now fairly comfortable – in tents but fairly dry. Irvingham has gone home for 30 days leave so I am left on my own once more & as it is to be for 30 days I get the corresponding pay & allowances so should be over flowing with wealth when he comes back. As it will then be nearly my turn for leave perhaps it will be just as well. There is no news – everything is very quiet & the only excitements we get are caused by the Daily Express, which whatever else it does stirs the imagination. Love to all – I trust Jane is comporting herself satisfactorily Yrs. Jack. ",1917-08-08,Glad
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter yesterday & for others from Mother Glad & Olive. I have heard from Cecily something of her doings & a little about the young man but really know very little yet. I gather that you may be seeing him shortly, when perhaps I shall hear more. Hill 60 is the area you mention. We are out of the line but moving up nearer to-morrow & will go in in our turn a few days later. I gather that things are pretty quiet there just now & shall raise no objections as they were distinctly lively when we left. The weather is once more fine & things are drying up. I went to a show given by one of the London Territorial Division's Troupes last night. They get the pick of the music hall & other performers & give a really first class show. Many congratulations on the P. L. Speech which I saw in the Herald. It ought to be published in booklet form. Love to all Jack ",1917-08-10,Father 
"My dear Mother, Thank you all for letters & a cake & a couple of novels & papers. The latter are very welcome, as we are out of the line & there is nothing much to do except training & one can't train all day. The Division who gave the guns was not ours & I do not know which it was – it might be the 12th or the 18th but I had not heard of the incident till I saw it in the Surrey Advertiser. We are in reserve but well out of the line & more or less out of range of anything but the longest guns, which don't worry about us. I expect we shall go up into the line in 3 days time but then we are to be in support which means a timed existence in deep dug outs with nothing to do our bit of the line seems to have settled down into its normal composure & things are fairly quiet there. We are all among the balloons here & they lie about on the ground & try & hide themselves behind bushes & things, but as they are about as big as a school of whales in one they are not successful. They provide a little entertainment however & the Bosch got one very neatly to-day. One of our men got one 2 days go & being very disturbed he went over & got a Bosch to make up, but none the less he has been condemned to a weeks patrolling of our front line for his sins & I don't suppose he will make such a mistake again. Please let Mrs. Russell know that because I have 3 sisters who have been enticed into the bonds of holy matrimony or the threats thereof, that is no reason why I should be & if she can't – manage it better than by writing about it, she had better say nothing. I shall be interested to hear about the new suggestion when he arrives. I regret that he plays poker, but I rather fancy that you married a man who knew a little of the game, so there is hope yet. Love to all Jack",1917-08-12,Mother 
"My dear Odd, I fear I have not written lately but I daresay you have heard something from letters I have written to the others. I fear I shall not be home in time to see your spouse before he sails & then you will be doing the reluctant grass widow for a bit. I am sorry for you, but the papers say that the war is just about finished, so you will be going out before long. Personally I hadn't noticed any great difference in the war & I happen to be in a fairly eligible situation to watch it. They let us know less about it than people at home & the only news we get except about things which directly concern us is from the London papers. There was the dickens of a strafe a few days ago which seemed to go for miles, but I have only heard what happened just alongside of us & don't know now whether there was anything more We get most extraordinary rumours of what has happened, but they are usually absolute fiction. We are living underground in a big system of tunnels, which are now some little way behind the line. They are really a number of narrow passages about 3 ft wide & never more than 5 ft 9 high & usually much less. They are a really large system as there must be at least 250 men here including several brigade staffs dressing stations etc. We are fairly comfortable as we have what was a Brigade Hqrs, though the bloke in charge of the tunnels tried to turn me out, as he wanted it for his office. However he didn't get it, though we let him live with us as a compromise. We have also got electric light & an electric fan which are very excellent, though for the last 2 days the engine has broken down & we have been distinctly stuffy. We come to the surface occasionally to see if the war is going on, but otherwise do nothing in particular & it is no place to take a country walk. The beauty of the place is that you feel so safe in it, though the ground above has been so knocked about that any decent Bosch shell would come right through without making any bones about it. However he hasn't worried us yet, & as he has lots to think about let's hope he continues to leave us alone. We shall get out of this to-morrow & go right back for a few days. Please thank Father Mother & Glad. for their letters. I am sending this home, as I am not sure where you are & they can see it there before sending it on. Yrs Jack. ",1917-08-18,Odd
"My dear Father, The enclosed has reached me. Will you do the necessary with it? I assume you got my cheque for car insurance. I now enclose £3. 3. 0 for the license, for which I am obliged to you for paying. We are back in reserve and having a placid time getting cleaned up & doing a little drill so that we shan't forget what little we ever knew. We are being swamped with a number of new 2nd Loots. They are men who were sent home earlier in the year to take commissions from the ranks & it remains to be seen how they pan out. Someone has just sadly remarked that they are not even as respectable as solicitors. We have had some like them before but never in such quantities, & they will want watching. The Divisional band has just arrived & is discoursing sweet music at the other end of the field. They are rather good & are trying with honeyed words to secure one of our signalers, who happens to be a performer of sorts, but I have resisted up to now. The Bandmaster will however get over me in time as he is a southern Irishman & full of blarney. Wonder of wonders our archies have brought down 2 bosches in full view in the last 2 days & they don't know themselves. The Bosch is very active in the air at nights & is dropping bombs from 9 – 11 every night & again about 2 – 3. We know when he is coming, but he does very little damage, though we are jolly careful about lights. They caught him in the searchlights last night & he showed up well. Love to the family Jack.

"My dear Father, You will be interested to hear they have given me a bar to my D. S. O. It came out in Divl. orders to-night. I don't yet know the exact reason, except that it is for our bit of the show on the 31st. July. I wonder if you could get from Spink or someone the right thing I have to wear. I think it is a rosette on the ribbon, but am not sure & I have seen a man wearing a small silver star on his ribbon & I fancy he was wrong to do so. I think the metal star is only for a bar to a Military Medal. We were rather bothered by the authorities yesterday with orders & counterorders & eventually lent to some neighbours who quite needlessly thought they were in difficulties, so we didn't know from one minute to the next what they were going to do with us. However after giving us a very uncomfortable night, we have returned to our own fold to-day & are carrying on normally. Luckily we managed to get into some dug outs early in the evening which their people wanted at 2 a. m & as we were there the officers had to make the best of it outside. The Bosch is about at the moment & I am holding my breath to blow out the candle when he is near, as we take care to show no lights when he is anywhere overhead. He is doing a lot of bombing at nights without any great result, but we look after the lights for safety. He dropped a bomb or two this afternoon to keep things lively but not within a quarter mile of us. Love to all Jack",1917-08-25,Father 
"My dear Father, I got your letters at 2. 30 this morning on getting back to camp from the trenches. The mails have been all over the place the last few days owing to the gale & presumably mines loose in the channel. I have been unable to write for the last few days as I have been very busy, my 2nd in Command being on leave and a new adjutant. However we had a quiet four days in a distinctly unpleasant part of the line & had the weather been reasonable, the tour would not have been so bad – as it was the men had quite enough of it when they got out. I hope to get some leave fairly soon, but can hardly do so till the C. O. gets back. I expect him within the next fortnight and perhaps earlier. Please thank Mother, G and O. for their letters, all of which arrived with yours. I suppose you will be getting Cecily home soon. I have no news. I wonder who the officer was of the Division on our right whom Mother saw. I should like to meet him, as we should have a lot to talk about. They were a pantomime & I, being on the flank of our lot, had to cope with them & they certainly taught me to trust no one you don't know. I don't believe they've got themselves sorted out yet I have a good deal to do at the moment, but will write again soon. Thank Glad for the photo of Jane. I am glad she is such a presentable infant, but I can hardly approve of such an unbending will, as expressed by the lines of her countenance, in one so young. Love to all Jack. P. S. Cecily wants my old Burberry. Is it worth sending it out, or will it keep till she returns. She can have it ",1917-09-01,Father
"My dear Mother, A line to let you know that I have more or less arrived at my destination & am now waiting for my gee to take me the final stage. I crossed late on Tuesday afternoon, & had time to get out to Wootton & look round. Mary Underhill was away & the only person on the place whom I knew was the carpenter, now aged 74. I was there an hour & saw a very fine exhibition of flying, presumably by an old boy, as he came over & did stunts round the house. I slept the night across the water & went to see Mrs. Cane, but she was out. I managed to get about 30 miles that day & took 7 hours about it. I had no idea trains could move so slowly. I slept the night in a rest camp & came on here (P-E there are 2 places it might be one north & the other south & you know which it is) to-day starting at 7. The latter part of the journey was very interesting as I had not seen the country for a long time & for a long distance it is a mere waste, over which we were drawn by a homely G. W. R. engine. This place is smashed to bits – not by shells but by the Bosch, & the club is about the only respectable building standing. I gather that we are not going to get the rest I expected, but if not in the line already will be in at once, so I trust that it keeps quiet. I have had to put my watch back again, so I shall get another extra hour in bed before long. Love to the family Jack. ",1917-09-29,Mother 
"My dear Father, I have one or two letters from the girls to acknowledge which I found on getting back. I finished my journey the other night in a car which I managed to get out of the Division having taken a dinner off them first. I had a job to find the Battalion as they were said to be in a village & when I got to the village it wasn't there & no one was to be seen, it being 11 p. m. However I eventually found a belated Y. M. C. A. bloke in his tent & so found the Battalion. We came into the line or rather into support the next day where we still are & are taking steps to improve our accommodation which is very bad & draughty & all the shelters will leak like sieves when the rain comes. At present we are having glorious days & chilly nights. I expect you are getting bombed nightly, but such events do not occur here & we almost welcome the sound of a shell as it breaks the silence. The front line seems very quiet & there is very little doing except for a few trench mortars. We did an attack here some little time ago & collared some ground & things have not quietened down yet, though it is now a picnic compared to our last place. I find the a large number of the Battalion have throats owing to the gassing we were in 3 weeks ago & no doubt mine was the same, though I didn't jump at the correct reason for it. The C. O. has gone to Brigade while the B. G. C. is on leave. We are living in huts in a quarry & wander about where we like. In the line we live in a deep dugout alongside a main road road & on emerging walk up the road to the front line with a bit of trench for the last 300 yards. There are no signs of strafing except that almost all the trees & villages are down, but the fields between are as they always were, only overgrown with weeds. We can get lots of vegetables for ourselves in the gardens, but the fresh milk & egg question is a difficulty as there are no occupied farms for miles. The A. aircraft people keep chickens as they have little else to do, but they have ceased to lay. Divisional Hqrs. keep their own cow & it would be quite easy for us to do so, but they are difficult to buy. There is an extraordinary sense of space here compared with our last area where the whole country is nothing but camps & transport lines, while you can go for miles here & never come across a soul. The sun has set, & our rations will consequently arrive at any moment. they don't come up by day as it is possible for the Bosch to see the road they might have to use & the Bosch might find a shell or two to chuck at them though personally I believe you could bring an army corps up in broad daylight & not a word said, however they will have to take this letter back, so I cease.

"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter. I had a very good week-end at Felpham. I went to Horsham in the pram on Friday & got down to Bognor at 6.30 where I found Gladys waiting for me & Olive busy cooking when we got in. They have a very nice little cottage & very comfortably furnished. Jo came over from Gosport for Saturday night & I came back here last night leaving at 6.30 & getting in by 11. I had a lot of trouble on the way back owing to lights & I had to stop at Rudgwick to pa buy some parafin at a pub, as I found that the lamps were practically all dry. Doreen is very well, but distinctly noisy at intervals & they suspect more teeth as the cause. She looks very flourishing. are you and Father or either of you going down this next week-end? They appear to expect you, & you will obviously have to go down some time. There is not much to do except house work & go for walks. We went in to Bognor twice & also once along the coast towards Littlehampton. They get an occasional woman in to cook for them & one every day to take Doreen out, so that Glad can get out for a bit.

"My dear Mother, Thanks for two letters and for others form the married women and that great correspondent William. We are back in our quarry, really quite a good quarry and the Bosch can strafe as much as he likes on top while we are in dug-outs tunneled into the side and about 40 ft down out of harms way. We go into the line again for a tour in 2 days and then right out. I didn't think we should have to go in again, but they have found it necessary to send us. There is no news. Things seem very quiet. I was sorry to hear about your finger, but hope it is quite all right now. I see you are going to get rationed and am afraid you will all be cut down to the lowest but perhaps the distribution scheme will help things on the whole. I don't fancy these German strikes are finished by a long way yet and next time they will be harder to control, particularly if he tries to attack, as I fancy he will get something to go on with.

"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from the family. I am glad your finger is better and that the Red Cross likes its new abode. Please thank Father for getting me the watch, which is just what I wanted. I hope to need it soon, as there is a competition going to be run between Battalions in the Division for the practise of various soldierly exercises and I shall want it in training our crowd. I shook hands with Duggy. himself two days ago, as he happened to be round here with various luminaries in his train and I shook some of their hands as well, so I'm a proud man the illegible. I thought Duggy's hand a little clammy. There is no news and if there was I couldn't give it. I have become a gardener and have been planting the waste in front of our mess (we have a Battalion mess now) with nodding snowdrops, celandine, winkles (peri) and other herbaceous flowers. Incidentally the frost came the next night and they all look pretty silly now, but I trust they will buck up in time. My greatest effort is a massed concentration of roses, which, barring the idiocy of the officer who stole them but in doing so left their roots behind, should do well. I am in some doubts whether to prune them and if so where. At present the spread long and thorny branches over the only path to the mess and by rights they should be cut down to the earth, but I'm afraid that to do so would completely ruin their present very slender chances of flowering. I expect they will get pruned automatically after a few people have been tangled up in them. so I will let them be. Perhaps I shall see Con McCausland and will then congratulate him on his engagement. I thought he had sworn eternal fidelity to the Wilson girl. However these young sparks will jump about so that one can't keep pace with them. My garden contains a rockery which is at once ornamental and useful. It is intended to keep out bits of bomb which the Bosch sheds round here from time to time and is in fact about due now, as it is a lovely moonlight night. I watch it daily, as it grows rapidly under my eagle eye, and am planting it with box at the moment. Love to all, Jack.",1918-02-16,Mother
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from you all. Also for books and magazines. We have now got enough for the present, as we have about 150 in the library, and they are sufficiently bulky to take about without getting more. However they are very much appreciated and as they get worn out I will ask for more. I suppose Cecily is home again now, and will be getting tied up soon. I can give no idea when I shall be back and I don't think they should wait for me. We are out of the line at the moment, and fairly comfortable, but the new officers mess is not built here yet, so we live in small huts and we have no garden. I went over to see my garden this afternoon and find that the most unexpected recovery has been made by lots of the plants and roses which I thought were quite hopeless. The snowdrops have become gigantic, as they ought seeing that they are planted in an old manure heap, and the most pessimistic of the periwinkles are in full bloom. The C. O. is away but comes back in two or three days time. We had an extraordinarily good troupe over here yesterday from Charlie Dignalts Division. We happen to be in the camp near the theatre. Our own Divisional troupe are poor, as they never were good and about a month ago they had a bomb dropped on them, which did not improve them and in fact they have only just reappeared since the incident. These people however are first class and produced two “ladies” who were most extraordinarily agile and made up into real charmers. I hope your meat rations will really help things, but I am sorry that you all have to go short and we get so well fed out here. They are at least taking the salvage question here really in hand and the amount that can be collected is extraordinary. If they collect and use it, they will save any amount of transport, as the ships will go back from France to England loaded instead of empty. The men are getting keen on it too, and any amount of stuff should now be saved which used to be wasted. Love to all, Jack.",1918-03-03,Mother
"My dear Father, I have owed you a letter for a long time, and have one from Mother and another from Cecily to acknowledge since I last wrote. The stop-watch suits very well, though I have not yet had an opportunity of using it. Many thanks also for the books which are a great boon. I will let you know when we want any more, but at present we have a lot to go on with. The weather has become quite springlike and the conditions round here are quite pleasant. We have not been in the line for more than a week, but will be going back in a few days. I have spent a large portion of to-day in a motor lorry, which on the roads here is about as uncomfortable a mode of conveyance is you can find anywhere. After a short time in one, the only hope of arriving whole is to stand up in it, as the shocks then are not so severe. I had a line from Jo. the other day, who has a last got out here having flown across and is up north somewhere. We had two correspondents here yesterday from the Surrey Mirror and Croydon Advertiser respectively, who are doing all the Surrey regiments on behalf of the County papers, so I daresay you will be seeing some of their impressions in the local rag shortly. Most unfortunately our prize liar is not here at the moment or the tale would have been twice as wonderful as it is likely to be now. We have a great personage coming round here to-morrow, great only in the military line. We prepared a special stunt for him the other day, but he failed to turn up, so now we are preparing nothing and perhaps he will arrive. I hope he will be duly satisfied. We expect to return to our haunts opposite the Bosch in a day or two and if this weather continues it will be quite pleasant, as things are very quiet there. Love to all, Jack.",1918-03-06,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last letter, also for others from Father Cecily Glad and Olive, also for a bottle of milk punch which arrived whole in spite of prognostications to the contrary. I have been rather seedy for some little time and am at the moment taking a few days off back in the Transport Lines, while the Battalion is in the trenches. I did not intend to go up at all but I may have to go for a day or so. It is very pleasant back here as the weather is A1. I got the invitation to the wedding, but am quite unable to promise to be there. But congratulations to Guy on his new appointment. It sounds very good and I will come and live at his lodge yet. I suppose he was too smart for them at Elswick as a Government Official, so they have had to take steps to keep him under observation. He will probably be Managing Director in a couple of years. Love to all, Jack. ",1918-03-21,Mother
"My dear Father, I got across all right last night, though I had some hours at Folkestone to put in before they thought of starting. I am going back to the old crowd, but they do not appear to be where I expected and I am starting off at 6. 30 a. m to-morrow on my travels to find them. They kept me back a day here to get fitted with a gas helmet or I should have gone up this morning. The crossing was very steady and had I not broken a bottle of hair oil, which saturated everything in my saddle bag, there would have been no incident worth recording. It is very wet to-day. Love to all, Jack.",1918-06-24,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your telegram. I got across all right yesterday without incident, except that I broke a bottle of hair oil in my saddle bag with the result that I could hardly sleep on account of the smell of cantharides on my py-jamas, and as I stayed in the club and occupied a cubicle in a long room, I cannot have been altogether popular with the rest of the inhabitants. I am going back to the old crowd and set off on my travels to find them to-morrow at 6.30 a. m. Beyond the fact that they are not where I expected them to be, I have no idea where they are and do not know if they are in the line or in rest. However I suppose I shall know to-morrow afternoon. Love from Jack.",1918-06-24,Mother
"My dear Father, I have been in the trenches the last few days, and have been pretty busy in relearning the arts of trench warfare and finding my way about. The whole area is a maze of old trenches and very confusing in consequence, but I have got the hang of it by now. Our mess is in an old crater and about 40 ft underground - rather dismal and mouldy in this gorgeous weather, so we have built ourselves a summer house upstairs where we live during the day and sleep below. The Bosch is very quiet, and barring a little shelling of back areas in the evening, there is nothing doing. I fancy he sleeps during the rest of the time. I have got a number of those 18 ½ year old boys now, most of whom are quite good, but one or two are still very juvenile and do not seem to be more than about 16. One of them burst into tears in the orderly room the other day (I wasn't back then) when run in by the Sergt. major for some small offense and two nights ago another had to be led in from No Man's Land when out on patrol, as he was weeping so bitterly. We can't have our patrols given away by the sound of lamentations, as it would not look well in any report. However it is only a question of time, and I gather they have come on amazingly since they joined us 2 months ago. The old Bosch seems to be taking his time about his next attack. He appears to have got the Spanish flu pretty badly, as I hear the other day that one of his divisions should have come into the line somewhere but could not do so, as they were all down with migraines. May the microbes continue to flourish say I. I hope Glad. is comfortable at Lelant she must have had an awful journey with that infant. Yours, Jack.",1918-07-02,Father
"My dear Olive, Many thanks for yours and also for letters from Father Mother and Cecily. I have been very busy the last few days and though we are out of the line, the weather has been beautiful and I have taken the Battalion out all and every day to get them away from their billets, which are extremely uninteresting, to some lovely country about 4 miles off, where we do a little battlefighting and sleep a lot. The men or rather boys seem to enjoy themselves out there and we got them some cricket and various odds and ends of games. Ronald Brookes has joined up and is becoming the image of Jo. I expect the latter to come over some time, as he is not very far off as birdmen go, but he appears to have a dud machine or something so may not fly over. It is very pleasing to hear that the Bosch has attacked somewhere other than here. Perhaps he will be so occupied there that he won't be able to do anything anywhere else, and we shall be able to enjoy the summer in peace. Love to all, Jack.",1918-07-17,Olive
"My dear Father, I suppose or hope if you have been able to get a seat in a train, that you are now at Lelant, and trust that you are getting a decent holiday. I find that I can use the telescope, you told me of, and if you will send it out you will have done a bit more to assist in strafing the Bosch. The Battalion is in the line, but I am out for a few days back in the Transport Lines, but will be going back in a day or two. There is plenty to do back here looking after the odds and ends we leave out of the line, drums transport and a number of men for training in various duties. There are a number of shows, sports and competitions on as well and at the moment the war here seems very far away and quite a secondary matter. They say the Bosch is very quiet up in front and from what one hears of what is going on round Soissons, I don't wonder. Somebody has discovered that most Battalions have acquired in the time they have been out here a limber or two more than they ought to have and I have shortly to sign a certificate to say that I have nothing more than I ought. Without committing perjury I shall find this a little difficult, but if they insist on this ridiculous suggestion, perjured I shall be, but they don't get my extra transport. However I may be able to evolve some other method of getting round the authorities. I find that Regular Officers have no qualms in such cases, but I take it more hardly. I have no news. Yours, Jack.",1918-08-07,Father
"My dear Mother Many thanks for your last. I am very glad to hear you are getting on all right and hope that you take a holiday soon (if there are still any seats in any trains), when you will get back to normal again. I have been in the line the last two few days, and things have been very quiet. I watched a Bosch or two through a telescope this morning. They appeared fat and fell fed but a little restive, and I don't wonder, as they were crossing a road on which our gunners have marked down pretty accurately and sometimes are chased therein by our 18 pdr. shells when the gunner observation officer has nothing else to do - i. e. is awake. They had fun with about 200 Bosches early the other morning who had collected together for in an unusual place for a presumably unlawful purpose and I will describe what happens as it is fairly descriptive of how things are run and does not give anything away. This collection swarm covey flock or what you will was discovered by my people who are on the look out for such things, and who promptly telephoned down so that we could let the guns loose and do some damage. As it was about 4 a. m, the gunner was naturally asleep (we have a gunner officer who sleeps at Battn. Hqrs. every night). He on this occasion was very methodical, and it took about half an hour to prod him into activity, find his place on the map and generally get him going. By that time he had discovered that his particular brand of gun could not reach the place, so then he had to ring up the Leavies and they had to be awoke and ungummed in the same way. However in due time they pooped off and the Bosch, who had kindly remained for at least an hour to let these preparations get complete, took to his heels and disappeared. Shortly after there arrived at the same spot an engine and a couple of red + coaches on their light railway. This waited for a quarter of an hour and then went off and shortly after 3 motor lorries, which loaded up with stretchers and they went off. At first we would suppose that the gunners had done some damage, but I think that in reality the 200 were Bosches who had been gassed by us the night before and had been sent down to wait for a train at a point which is out of range of our 18 pdrs. Unfortunately they were spotted and had to bolt and I am glad to say that there is nothing worse for a lightly gassed case than unusual exertion, so I trust they are all seriously gassed now. The Bosch gassed us here a bit last night and Battn. Hqrs. sat round a table sneezing and choking in unison for about 20 minutes. it must have been a pathetic sight. Love to all, Jack.",1918-08-17,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter and the telescope, which has arrived and is in use and will prove very useful. I am glad you had good weather in Cornwall. Please thank Olive for all the various things she has bought and sent me, which have arrived safely. The records are very good and what I wanted. The news is all very good and one can only wonder how far the battle is going to spread. Everyone seems to be pushing at the Bosch except us, and we continue to lead our placid existence. It is quite difficult to keep pace with these various attacks and to know whether such and such a “200 guns captured” refers to a new stunt or to those taken by General Somebody Else last Tuesday week. They will soon be fighting for Delville Wood and Guillemont and such like places which I used to know. There are all sorts of rumours that the Bosch is going right back, but as they emanate from the papers they are probably quite incorrect. I have no news. Yours, Jack.",1918-08-25,Father
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from Mother and yourself also for post cards of Gladys' haunts. I had a letter from Graham to-day - late of 17 Albemarle St. He is a Lieut. in a M. T. section rather from necessity than choice as they kicked him out of the infantry because of his eyes. All is quiet here. The Bosch seems very windy in front and as I hear the Canucks have broken through the Drocourt-Quéant line, the local bit of the Hindenburg do, this morning, one rather wonders whether he will not have to betake himself to a more salubrious spot. The weather is colder but not so bad and it would be rather amusing to start a chasse. It is a very good sign that he has cleared off Kemmel, as anyone who has been near there knows what wonderful observation one can get from it. I can even see the place from here where it is moderately clear, and we are a fair distance away I find tobacco is very hard to get now. I wonder if you would mind calling on one or other of the tobacconists round Albemarle St. Simmons or Savory in Piccadilly or Junior Army and Navy or Civil Service, and getting them to send me fortnightly a half pound of some cool smoking medium strength to-bacco. At present I smoke John Cotton or Navy Mixture. If you will settle them for a month and get them to promise to carry on, I will send you and them a cheque in payment. I don't know what I have to pay now probably 3/- or 4/- a quarter, but that can't be helped. Love to all, yours, Jack.",1918-09-02,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your last letter and for others from Father and the three gals. Also for some magazines from C and O. The news seems very good and it is extraordinary that I see in to-night's wire that they are to-day in the village into which we used to go back from the trenches for our 3 or 4 days rest last spring. By the time you get this letter I expect they will be up in our old front line against the Hindenburg Line in that area. I see that the papers are talking a lot about the capture of Lens, but I have seen no reports that we are actually in the place. It is right down in a hollow anyhow and of no earthly use to anyone except Editors However it is a useful tag on which to hang their demonstrations. I hope however they will not ring joybells when it is taken, as we shall promptly be kicked out, if they do. Things are very quiet where we are and I am very much afraid that the Bosch will start retreating in which case our present comfort will be seriously compromised particularly as he is certain to blow up all his dug-outs and fill the rest with booby traps and gas before he goes back, and we shall have to live neath the canopy of heaven. I hate that sort of life which seems to me about the worst havoc of war and it always rains under those conditions. We are out of the line at the moment and have a very comfortable headquarters in a place which has been kept constantly repaired, so that if there weren't a few guns stuck about all round and one particularly noisy one about 200 yards off, the war might be very distant. Love to all, Jack.",1918-09-07,Mother
"My dear Father, Very many thanks for your letter and trouble. I enclose my cheque for the £1, and shall be very glad when the stuff arrives, as at the moment I am smoking the ration issue which appears to be made mostly of Virginia creeper with a flavoring of canariensis. We are out of the line at the moment, doing a little training and cleaning up, but the weather is against us, as the last 2 or 3 days have been wet. I hope the autumn rains have not set in, as it will have a tremendous effect on the offensive. Their communications must be very difficult as it is. I think tanks must have been largely responsible for its success, as I know the casualties have been very light for most of the time and I do not believe the heavy losses. I think after last summer they have learnt the wisdom of not pressing on against overwhelming opposition, and nowadays try somewhere else. They appear to be moving in the South from one of our defensive lines, which we made last winter on to the next and I fancy progress will be slow, as they are all among the thousands of miles of wire, which we put out in that area and never used, and I don't suppose the Bosch has had time to reel it all up. In any case it looks as though he is not going to make much of a stand this side of the Hindenburg line, though I suppose he is bound to resist there, if he had any self-respect left. Love to Mother Yours Jack. I wonder if you would send me out a dry Battery Ever-ready No 126. I have increased my cheque accordingly and as the girls have flown, will you keep the change, as I may ask you again later on for other odds and ends.",1918-09-09,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for letters from you all. Also for tobacco and a battery from Father - the former very welcome. I came out of the line last night, a few days before the Battalion, as I have got one or two things to look after back here. There is nothing doing at the moment and the Bosch is only too glad to be left alone. It is interesting to see that they have got back the whole of the line we used to hold in the South last spring and in fact rather more. It will be dreadful country to live in during the winter as it was bad enough last year when we had time to put up huts during the summer, but now I don't quite see what they will do, as I don't suppose there is much left and we burnt most of the timber round there last year, so it looks as if they are going to be a bit chilly later on. Our new piano has at last arrived, rather battered by the journey, but its vitals appear to work all right. At present I have got 12 Pioneers gluing screwing and nailing it together, and as they are a useful lot, between them I think they will get it to work. Love to all. Jack.",1918-09-22,Mother
"My dear Father, Thanks for a letter from you and for another from Mother Cecily. I fear you will have a chilly time on the moors if this weather goes on. Still the house should be warm enough with the pigs on the ground floor. I am glad Fellowes looked you up. He will be back in a few days and I shall want him badly, as Rowland is in England at Aldershot and I have just lost another officer at Hqrs. I am trying to get Gery Clayton out, but don't know if he can manage it. I hear they have got Lens, and hope they enjoy it. I am quite sure the Bosch has left nothing in the way of shelter behind and it will be an uncomfortable business following him up. I believe it is the same near Cambrai and even Divisional Hqrs have to be out in a field, so what Battalions will do, I don't know. I saw one of the Brighton Tank Engines to-day hunting a troop train up a hill - probably one that had often taken me to town in the 9-25, but now employed on another service. The 24 hours time looks ridiculous at present but I suppose we shall get used to it. Love to the Ashers, Jack.",1918-10-03,Father
"My dear Mother, Thanks for your letter, also for others from the gals. I am glad the teeth are coming through satisfactorily. I should like to see the two mothers coping with their families. I am sure they do it very badly and have long and earnest conferences with the nurse to get them out of their difficulties. Luckily both infants look as if they can put up with a good deal. I trust the R. S. P. C. C. has not had occasion to call oat the Lowans yet. I have nothing to tell you. We are out of the line and endeavoring to combine as much training with as little damage to crops as possible. I have already had trouble with the Maire, as he won't give up his schoolroom for use in the evenings as a recreation room for the men and I have been very rude to him - vicariously - as I don't know how to be rude in French. Love to all, Jack.",1918-10-03,Mother
"My dear Mother, A line to let you know I am flourishing, but rather busy as we are engaged in a more active role than we have been recently, owing to the Bosch retirement along the line. I have not slept 2 nights in succession in the same place for a fortnight as we generally move 3 or 4 kilometres one way or another each day. Best wishes to G. on her birthday. Yours, Jack.",1918-10-12,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from you all. You appear to have had a good time in the north and to have been kept pretty busy. I hope you have had my card by now, but I was unable to write more, as I have got slightly gassed - in the eyes, with the result that for the last few days they have ceased to function and have been unable to do anything. At the moment I am in hospital and still in bed but expect to get up in a day or two and shall get back as soon as I can. I have just heard the news that we have Lille, which is great and makes one wonder whether the Bosch won't have to give in soon. He seems to be fighting, particularly as up in the north they have done what they liked, but where I have been lately he is still putting up a very good show and has plenty of ammunition to spare. I had a very interesting week before I got gassed, as we had one or two scraps and chased him for about 8 miles in the time. The weather was fine for most of the time, so we did not do so badly. I am on the sea coast at the moment, but have not seen the sea yet as I've not been out. I only got down yesterday. Yours, Jack.",1918-10-18,Father
"My dear Cecily, Many thanks for many letters. I have been very busy since the end of last month, when we began to get on the move, and I have not had time since to do my duty in the letter writing line. At present I am in hospital with gas but expect to go back in a day or two. I got it mostly in the eyes with the result that I couldn't see a yard for several days. However they are quite all right now and after a little more acclimatising I shall go and seek my lambs again and I fancy they will take a good deal of finding as no one seems to stop more than a day or two in one place at the moment. I hope Guy is flourishing and likes his new job, seeing that in a week or two wars are apparently to be no more I suggest he turns his inventive brain into more peaceful channels. He had better invent a machine to fill up trenches. If it is a success he will make a lot of boodle and he will be able to run a park, of which I can be the Lodge keeper and it will keep Armstrong quiet. Seriously if he could do it and be first in the field with a competent machine when war is over he could do jolly well out of it. I have no news in particular. I don't think you ever came to this particular spot when you were out here. It is a small port with three or four hospitals and full of Allies of various kinds including coolies. I am looked after very well and meals seem to follow in a constant stream and I am always ready for them. Fellowes is here with me and three more of my fellows in another room so we celebrate the occasion to-morrow night (if I can get round the Com- mandant) at the local Ritz. Love, Jack.",1918-10-20,Cecily
"My dear Glad, I owe you a birthday letter but for various reasons I have not been able to write. As you may have gleaned by now I am in hospital at the moment with gas, but expect to be able to go back to the Battalion in a few days. I got caught in a day and nights gassing a week ago with the result that 24 hours later I couldn't see and after various vicissitudes I arrived at a Base hospital. My eyes are quite right now but I still look as though I was just recovering from a complicated attack of all the poxes you can think of at once and I should not care to have to do a long day in the field just yet. I was out for a stroll yesterday and a longer walk to-day and in two or three days I expect to be quite normal, by which time perhaps if the war goes on at is present pace it should be nearly over. Most of the Battalion Hqrs. Staff are here and they have had to import another a fellow from another Battalion to run it in my absence. The hospital is in better times than a good class hotel and I am very comfortable on the ground floor and well looked after. I expect there are various letters to thank you for waiting for me with the Battalion but as they don't know where I am they have not forwarded them. The French are extraordinarily elated abuot the retaking of Lille judging from the people here. I am glad the two kids are so flourishing. Love to all, Jack.",1918-10-20,Glad
"My dear Father, Many thanks for letters from you and from G and O. I am much better now and expect to go back in a couple of days, as the effects of the gas have nearly gone. It is quite pleasant here and I have had a game or two of golf on a 6 hole course near the hospital. At other times I have been out to neighbouring villages to see the sights and there is always a game of billiards to while away the time. My eyes are quite all right, but I must have swallowed other gasses besides mustard and the effect takes longer to go off. You seem to have had plenty to do on your holiday. I am rather wondering what the Battalion is doing. They can't be far from the push mentioned in to-day's papers but whether they are in it I don't know. Love to all, Jack.",1918-10-24,Father
"My dear Father, Just a line to thank you for your letter. I go back to the Battalion to-morrow and should reach it with luck the day after. I gather that they are still resting behind the line and do not expect to go back till after I get back. I have sent a line to the rest of the family. Yours, Jack.",1918-10-25,Father
"My dear Father, Excuse the paper, but I appear to be running short. We are still out of the line, but anticipate going up to do our normal tour in 2 or 3 days, unless the Bosch gives in first, as I trust he will shortly think it wise to do. I don't see how he can hope for anything now that Austria is out and the whole of Southern Germany is open to invasion, but one cannot say for certain. It will certainly be interesting if we have to march after him to the Rhine and spend the winter there. I don't fancy he is keen on allowing the allied troops to spend too much time in Germany. There are one or two refugees here, who were in the village while the Bosch was in it and are very full of the life they led. Apparently they were forced to walk in the fields in gangs with a Bosch armed with a whip to look after them and all the crops were collared for the Bosch army. The villagers had to subsist on their garden produce and what they got through the American Relief Commission. However they got their own back a little in various ways, as they would never learn a word of German, which used to annoy him dreadfully and they used to tell him at times what they really thought. At present we are being at times bombarded with leaflets from the Bosch, enquiring why we continue to fight, but they are not very convincing. Love to all, Jack.",1918-11-01,Father
"My dear Father, So that's that. Our next difficulties will arise in keeping the men occupied before peace is declared and afterwards till demobilized, which I presume will be done gradually out here. There is an educational scheme in the army, which I propose to develop, as it will be mere bathos to keep the men on ordinary military work, when they never hope to touch a rifle again. What I want however personally is to be able to give a number of lectures on interesting subjects e. g the steam engine, petrol engine, Land Tenure, Constitutional History (Bagehot wrote a short chatty book on this) etc. I wonder if you could send me out half a dozen handbooks on this kind of subject, so that I can give some more or less correct facts on some such subjects. We are well behind at the moment as the Bosch has gone so fast but I doubt if we stay here, as we are crowded in with a lot of civilians and the men have none too much room to themselves. The Division has got a very good chit from the Corps Commander, and I think they put up a very good show in the beastliest conditions of weather. I hope to get some leave at the end of the month and look forward to see you. Yours, Jack.",1918-11-11,Father
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter and for the books, which will do me well till I get home. I hope you are keeping an account of all I owe you, as it must be getting a large sum by now. I don't fancy I shall be back as soon as I hoped, as we are still messing about here. We move to Rumegies, about 10 miles North of this on the 26th, which is in the area the Division is finally going to occupy, and we go to our final destination at the end of this month or early next month. We shall be somewhere near Tournai, though I cannot say exactly where. I shall not take leave till we get settled down definitely, unless it is obviously going to take some time, when I may come back first. Many thanks for going down to see Smith. He had been with me for a long time, and is a very good fellow. Ronald Brookes told me he had been to see you, but you were not in. He has got a Military Cross and is very pleased in consequence. I have no news in particular and have done practically nothing these last few days. We have had a certain amount of football and one or two concerts. The Battalion orchestra has been greatly improved by the addition of a couple of really good violinists, and as we have also acquired a cello, it will not be so bad. I have also managed to get nearly £10 out of Cramers for damage to our piano, which they sent out so badly packed that the casing was knocked to bits, but which damage has not affected its playing capacity in the least. Love to all, Jack.",1918-11-23,Father
"My dear Mother, For once in the way I have no letter from one or other of you to acknowledge since I wrote two days ago. We have moved here to-day, about 11 miles North of Somain over some very cobbly roads, which grew more and more cobbly as we came nearer here. This place is a bit knocked about, but fairly comfortable and we do not expect to stay more than 3 or 4 days when we shall go on to our final resting place. I do not yet know more than that it will be somewhere West of Tournai, and am naturally very anxious to find out as the quality of the billets will make a lot of difference to our comfort, and if we can find a place for concerts and others for dining rooms, we shall do well. The Bosch had a large filling factory here, - a number of huts dug into the ground, as you see at Brock's place at Sutton, and all full of the tallest and fattest minnies I have seen. Owing to lack of accomodation, I have a Company billeted all among them and pray that the place doesn't go up - not that they won't deserve it, if they go sky high, as it will be their own fault, but I fear the village will also go and take me with it. However the place will have its uses, as the authorities are always impressing on one the necessity for salvage, so I propose to salve as many of the huts as possible, as they will be extraordinarily useful at our final place. I had an unfortunate occurrence yesterday as my horse and I disagreed as to the way to cross a stream, with the result that we went in together. I got wet through and covered with a most dreadful smell, as between us we had stirred up the mud of ages. However neither of us are the worse. Love from Jack.",1918-11-26,Mother
"My dear Mother, A merry Xmas to you all. I am sorry I have not been able to get home for it but I really think I shall get back early in January and may see some of you if not all. Many thanks for your last letter and for one from Father. It is a pity the election causes trouble, though I hardly imagine that the effects will cause much bitterness. You will be able to strafe each other a little more openly. I suppose Cato will get in fairly easily. I am at Baisieux, between Lille and Tournai - 14 kilometres from the former and 8 from the latter. We are gradually spreading out, as more troops leave the place to go to their proper areas and I hope everyone will have gone in a few days and let us settle down. I have had a fellow in Paris the last few days getting Xmas dinners, and he has now returned after buying a sufficiency for everyone, but has not been able to bring the stuff with him, though he has seen it on to a truck and I trust it will materialise in a few days. However there is a risk yet, as trucks have a habit of getting off on to weird sidings unknown to everyone and I have horrible nightmares of good pork and fat geese left unprotected near some camp, where they will be kindly attended to by the inhabitants and we shall go without. The thought is too terrible. They are threatening us with (as all New Army Battalions) with the burden of a Silk Union Flag - otherwise Union Jack, to take the place of Colours but to be treated in all respects with the same reverence and devotion. We have got along without the beastly thing for 4 years, so why we should be burdened now I cannot say. It will involve horrible ceremonies of consecration and such like and will bore everyone to tears. I can see myself at the end laying it up somewhere - probably with dreadful ceremony though preferably in a bowler hat with the thing in a brown bag. We have got Madame dining with us to-night with her son who has just come from England where he has been for the last 4 years running some business or other. I trust we have got something to give her, but one never knows these days. Love to all, Jack.",1918-12-19,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your letter to-day. I shall be interested to see the Barrow Worsfold Controversy in the Herald. Are you out of the tumble now, or is the displeasure of the Grove still heavy on you? I liked the quotation à propos the Abbey. It must have been an awe inspiring sight in any case. I wonder the roof did not fall in. Did someone compare a War March of the Lawyers on the lines of Athalie or did they play the Robbers Chorus from Chu Chin Chow. I have been waiting to hear from Maitland, but if the thing is urgent I will readily take it on. I hope to get home early next month to talk about things. The question in my mind is in no way as to what you can offer, but what use I can make of it. My chief trouble is that I have forgotten the little law I ever knew, though I may be making too much of the difficulties of picking it up again. I daresay the Law Society will organise lectures etc to put one au fait again. We had quite a good Xmas and the last of the festivities is to come off to-night - a Sergeants' dinner and concert I certainly hope the prosperity to which you refer is coming your way next year. It seems hard lines that you should now be hauled out to drill, particularly as they are beginning to demobilize (or demoralize, as some one said) the police and you should be free in a month or two. Love to Mother and many thanks for her letter. Yours, Jack.",1918-12-28,Father
"My dear Mother, Many thanks for your letter, and a book. I am looking forward to seeing you again shortly. The Xmas festivities - what there were of them - have passed off satisfactorily and I think the men had (blow the pen) as good a time as circumstances permitted. I got a concert going for the evening, and as we had got some extra rations and a fair amount of beer they did not do so badly. One of the Companies is now very busy on a production of Chu Chin Chow, which should at least be amusing and promises to be quite good. The paper has just arrived and I see you have established Cato satisfactorily. I fancy the Grove will be more unforgiving than before, though I doubt if Samuel really thought he would get in. He pulled more than I expected. They have got a very good pantomime in Lille including Leslie Henson and several first class London people. I hope to get over there in a night or two, but it is 10 miles off and the drive back at night is not pleasant. I was over there the other day and had a look round the place. It seemed very normal, but shabby, as they have done no painting for the last 4 years. There are some fine buildings there. I believe the Bosch has taken the fittings from every factory in the place, so the French will have difficulty in starting their industries again. At times the water supply ceases and they won't then give you enough water to shave, so the place has its discomforts. Love to all, Jack.",1918-12-30,Mother
"My dear Father, I was much interested in the Herald & see you have defeated Lovelock at all points. You may be interested in my views as to the proposed memorial, to help you come to a decision, but I should prefer not to come into the controversy at all and you can make use of them or not as you like. 1. Carshalton is not the only place in difficulties as to a memorial. There is a fellow writing in the Spectator this week for suggestions for a memorial for Windermere. 2. Is the memorial intended to meet with the wishes of those it commemorates. If so, though you cannot ask them, you can get the opinions of the men who were in very similar circumstances, from discharged sailors & soldiers or men of a Battalion in France. 3. It seems to me as yet too early to come to a decision, & you ought to wait till the men now serving have a say. 4. What is to my mind required in the future in every village is a club for all men who have served the country in an active capacity in the war. There is no question that such a system would retain the Espirit de Corps of the nation ^ army & be of infinite benefit to the nation in a number of ways. I see signs of this idea taking root & it might be that some general scheme would be arranged by a Governmental Body. 5. The hospital scheme is no doubt required but it is for the benefit of the individual, whereas the club scheme will benefit so many directly, many more indirectly that it may be said to be for the general benefit. In fine – my own view is that you should accept suggestions & do no more as yet. It is a filthy day & no golf is possible. Yours Jack. ",1919-01-14,Father
"My dear Mother, I am back again after a quiet crossing on the 4th & 20 hours in the train yesterday & early this morning. I left Calais by the 8.30 ^ a. m which actually got on the move at 10.30 & after a most tedious journey crawled into Lille at 6. p. m. It then stood in the station for 4 ½ hours & eventually decided to go to Tournai by an entirely different way to the one in the time table, so that I could not get out here as I had intended, but came out from Tournai as early as I could this morning. We are 550 strong and losing 10 to 15 men a day at present. The weather is cold & there is a lot of snow on the ground, but everyone seems very comfortable. I have arrived just in time for the formal presentation of our colours, which was put off yesterday because of the weather, so I fancy it will take place next week. I hope you are not going to have too bad a time with all these strikes. I stayed with the Fellowes on Monday night & thus avoided the hotel strike the next morning. I find the civilians have become quite amenable & the trouble- some ones now feed out of our hands. Love from Jack. I have not thanked either of you enough for your share of the watch. It is a ripping present. ",1919-02-06,Mother
"My dear Father, Many thanks for your two last letters and for one from Mother. I hope you will get invited to the Shrove Tuesday function, but you can hardly expect too much. The snow and frost have gone and spring is showing signs of coming on. This place ought to be very pleasant when the leaves are out, and I see no signs of a complete dispersal yet awhile. I have still a 300 draft waiting to go to Germany, and it is a little difficult to know what to do with them till they go, as the ground is too heavy for games as yet and there is a general atmosphere of slackness about everyone under present conditions. We are beginning to send away some of our animals, which go down in droves to the base either for transport to England or in the case of the worst of them for sale out here. The farmers about here are beginning to get various beasts to do their work, and there are one or two teams of ex-British army mules working in the field and one at least of 3 cows abreast. The French look after their animals well. They threatened to move us into Tournai this week but have now changed their minds and we stay, as the station here is to be the one from which the Division is to be demobilized. The cadre of a Battalion, i. e. those who are left to see the rest away, are included in the new rates of pay, so I benefit to the extent of 5/6 a day Love to Mother. Yours Jack. The cross for Arthur Taylor’s son is not yet ready, but I will have it put up when it is. ",1919-02-22,Father
"My dear Father, Thanks for two letters. I paid off the Civil Service Stores for tobacco & was rather surprised to get another lot from them two days ago. I put it down to delay in the post, as such events happen sometimes, but evidently as I did not cancel the order they are beginning again. If you are passing would you mind telling them to stop it & I will send them a cheque. I would send it now only I don’t know if you will be able to stop the next supply. I find that somehow your telescope has been swopped for another – just as good but not the same identical one. Probably it occurred on a relief by another Battalion. However I hope you will not mind the difference. The only difficulty is that as the other is a Government one, it will be the broad arrow. I can do nothing about Edginton. As a Prisoner of War, he was off my strength from the 21st. March, and I am absolutely in the dark about the movements of men afterwards unless I happen to hear of them privately. I am afraid that he has died as a Prisoner of War, but the only way is to find out from the authorities. Tournai Cemetery is at the S. W. end of the town next door to the Civilian Cemetery. I have just come back from a tour round Messines Kennel and Ypres. Interesting but cold. I saw several parts of the line from the Bosch point of view, which I used to know rather better from our own. The only inhabitants of the area are Bosch prisoners. Yours Jack. ",1919-03-07,Father
"My dear Father, It occurs to me that the enclosed device may be worth patenting or copyrighting – I forget which is correct in the circumstances. Can you tell me what it would cost to get the necessary done – in all countries? I should also like to know what you think of the idea. An alternative scheme is to offer the thing unpatented to some firm on their undertaking to take out the patents & pay so much down or per article sold – if they used them, but I should not do this unless I knew something of them. Two firms, the Swan & Jewel are both advertising non-self-filling pens & they must be feeling the competition of the self-filling varieties & might take up this idea. Personally I am very hopeful of the idea but that is probably usual with a true and first inventor, if I am so. I am prepared to spend some money on the idea & will pay the costs necessary to search the Registers to see if this idea can be patented & if you can get that done for me I shall be much obliged. By the way I am a member, or will be when I’ve paid my entrance fee & subscription, of the United University Club. Remember me to Wm. Ellis & George Daw. Yours Jack. I had Arthur Taylor’s son’s grave made up & turfed & was waiting for it to look better before I had it photographed. I see now that the graves people do that, so I think it best to let him make his own arrangements. The device works as follows. The Inner tube being full of air at the start, it is emptied by blowing down the top of the Reservoir. The air pressure in the reservoir drives the air from the tube. In the event of pockets of air forming in the tube, these are emptied by the inner metal tube. When empty & if the pen is inserted in ink by suction the inner tube will become filled. The question of the arrangement of a valve, if necessary, at the nib end of the pen to enable ink to be drawn in more quickly may have to be considered but is not part of the device. The device is contrived by intended to enable a fountain pen to be filled by suction by the mouth without the necessity of a filler-pump or other device. A tube of thin tough material impervious to ink is fastened inside the pen. The end of the tube nearest the nib is so fastened that ink can be drawn in or flow out. The top end of the tube is sealed up. The Reservoir of the pen containing the tube is open at the top (away from the nib) & the pen is so made that the end of the reservoir nearest the nib admits no air between itself and the outer wall of the tube. Within the tube is fastened a narrow metal tube with holes in it, at intervals, running the whole length of the Reservoir & open at both ends. In practise this may not be necessary.

"My dear Father, It occurs to me that you and Mother would like to go to the Queens Memorial Service at Guildford on Saturday the 31st inst. at Holy Trinity Guildford at 3.30. There was an advertisement in the Morning Post of the 22nd & probably the Times of the same day & you should check my statement, as I have not got the paper in front of me. I have sent your names to the Hon. Secretary, Memorial Service, ^ Stoughton Barracks Guildford & said that you will pick up your tickets at the Church Door. A line to him will confirm this. I am sending Fellowes as he will be on leave then. Yours Jack. ",1919-05-24,Father
"My dear Father, We go to Antwerp to-morrow & I expect to be in England in a day or two Prees heath – near Whitchurch – is our destination. I will let you know when I get back. I am asking various people to write to me at 17 Albemarle St. Would you mind forwarding any letters there may be for me when I send you my address in England. Many thanks for letters from Mother and yourself. Yours Jack. ",1919-05-31,Father
"Dear Father, Thanks for yours. I go to the 3rd. Battn. at Clipstone on the 13th, so please forward no more letters & I will call for them at Albemarle St. on the 14th. I have handed in my stores & demobilized everyone except Fellowes & 2 servants. I did well & lost nothing on the journey except a half cooker (i. e the front half of a travelling cooker) & a Stokes Mortar. Considering the way the things were handled by the stevedores, this is not bad. As I pointed out to the ordinance fellow he could hardly expect me to be incomplete, as my stores are laid out in a hut opposite the stores of another Battalion, which was checked last week, & my R. Q. M. S. would obviously not miss such a heaven sent opportunity, if he was deficient anywhere. Many happy returns of the 13th Yours Jack. ",1919-06-11,Father
